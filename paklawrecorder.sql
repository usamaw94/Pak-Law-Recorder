This appeal, by leave of the Court, has been directed against the order of the High Court dated 8-5-2012, whereby the writ petition filed by the appellant has been admitted for regular hearing. \n\n2. The brief facts culminating into this appeal are that respondent No.1 filed a writ petition in the High Court alleging therein that he purchased Plot No. 163-C situate in Sector F-3, Part III, Mirpur which was allotted to Abdul Karim on 4-4-1990. Prior to respondent No. 1, the plot was sold and transferred in the name of two persons and ultimately he purchased the plot on 15-7-2009 against a price of 4.5 million rupees and it was duly transferred in his name. It was claimed that the same place was allotted to one Shamsunnisa, showing it as Plot No. 164-B/3 and forged allotment orders were issued on 13-12-1997 and 7-9-2002. The inquiry was conducted by the M.D,A.., and it was found that the appellant''s plot, i.e., No. 163-C actually is located at the site of plot No.164-B/3, therefore, it was recommended that the appellant''s plot be readjusted at the site of plot No. 164-B/3. After readjustment of the plot, the allottee of plot No. 164-13/3 transferred the same to respondent No.12. A learned single Judge in the High Court sought para-wise comments. After seeking para-wise comments and hearing arguments, writ petition was admitted for regular hearing through the impugned order on 8-5-2012. Hence this appeal by leave of the Court.\n\n3. Ch. Muhammad Siddique, Advocate, the learned counsel for the appellant, argued that the order passed by the High Court is against law and the Constitution,.which is not sustainable in the eye of law. He argued that the appellant filed para-wise comments before the High Court along with objections on the stay order application, where he categorically took the stance that the writ petition is not maintainable on the ground that the appellant has concealed the facts from the Court as he had already filed a declatory suit in respect of the same plot in the Court of Senior Civil Judge, Mirpur, which is sub judice for adjudication. The learned counsel further contended that in presence of the civil suit, the writ petition was not maintainable as he has already availed the alternate remedy provided under law. He filed the copies of the stay order, plaint and other documents with the written statement/objections but the learned High Court has not taken into account and instead of dismissing the writ petition admitted it for regular hearing without adhering to the law on the subject as the same remedies in a matter cannot be availed at two different forums at the same time. The learned counsel averred that it is also admitted position that the suit was filed on 15-12-2010 before the Civil Court prior to filing of the writ petition before the High Court, which was filed on 22-3-2011. He argued that the order impugned before this Court is not a speaking order, which does not come within the definition of order as no ground has been assigned for admission of the writ petition. He further argued that the learned High Court while passing the impugned order has not given any reason or discussed the objections raised by the learned counsel for the appellant. He also stated that while filing para-wise comments/objections, he raised the point that the writ petition is hit by the doctrine of laches but no finding has been recorded in the impugned order in this regard, which has been passed without due application of judicial mind. He maintained that both the parties are claiming their respective plots at one and the same place and this controversy can only be resolved after recording the evidence, which is not the job of the High Court under the writ jurisdiction. It is celebrated principle of law that the factual controversies cannot be resolved through writ petition. He contended that the appellant constructed a house over the plot measuring 1 kanal, which was purchased by him from respondent No. 11, whereas, the respondent is also claiming the plot on the same place on the strength of transfer letter, while alleging that he has purchased 10 marlas land. The learned counsel drew the attention of this Court towards the prayer clause of the writ petition and the plaint, while arguing that the same relief has been claimed in the suit, which has been prayed in the writ petition. He has relied upon the cases reported as Akhlaq Ahmed v. Secretary to the Government of Punjab, Local Government and Rural Development Department, Lahore and 2 others [1998 SCMR 516] and Nawab Syed Raunaq Ali and others v. Chief Settlement Commissioner and others [PLD 1973 SC 236].\n\n4. On the other hand, M/s Younus Tahir and Sheikh Masood Iqbal, Advocates, the learned counsel for the respondents, while controverting the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant, argued that no illegality has been committed by the High court, while passing the impugned admission order. They argued that the relief claimed in the writ petition is quite different, than the relief claimed in the suit, therefore, the writ petition is not barred by law. They contended that the respondent has become aggrieved by the act of the appellant and the official respondents and the only remedy for him was to file the writ petition. He has rightly availed the remedy of writ jurisdiction. They argued that the proceedings of the department have been challenged, which does not come within the purview of civil suit, whereas, in the suit the declaration has been sought. They further submitted that only admission order has been passed and no final verdict .has been given by the High Court as the matter is sub judice before the Hon''ble Court and the appellant has full opportunity to put his version before the High Court. They argued that the points raised before this Court can be argued before the learned High Court and if the Court is convinced, then an appropriate order shall be passed, which stage has not come as yet but instead of pursuing the matter before the High Court, he has approached this Court, which amounts to pre-empt the jurisdiction of the High Court, which is not warranted under law. They have relied upon the cases reported as Azad Government and others v. Sahibzada Ishaq Zafar and others 1994 MLD 2382, Azad Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and others v. Maj. General (Rtd.) Muhammad Hayat Khan and another 1995 SCR 283 and Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council and 3 others v. Muhammad Ikram and 3 others 2007 SCR 155.\n\n5. We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record made available along with the other material brought on the record. The controversy involved in the matter is regarding plot No. 163-C, measuring 10 marlas, situated in Sector F-3, part-HI, Mirpur, which was allotted to Abdul Karim on 4-4-1990. Lastly, the same was purchased by respondent No.1 on 15-7-2009 against the consideration of Rs. 4.5 million rupees and the same was transferred in his name, whereas, the appellant is also claiming that his plot, i.e., 164-B/3 measuring 1 kanal is also situated at the same place, meaning thereby, both the parties are claiming that they are owners of the plots situated at the one and same place. It has not been denied by the respondent that a civil suit has also been filed before the civil Court on 15-12-2010, i.e., prior to the writ petition, filed on 22-3-2011. The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that the same relief has already been prayed in a civil suit, which is sub judice before the Court of competent jurisdiction and the remedy available under law has already been availed, therefore, the writ petition was not competent. To appreciate the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant, it will be useful to reproduce the prayer as sought by respondent No.1 before the Civil Court reads as under:--\n\nThe prayer clause of amended writ petition, reads as under:--\n\n ""Under the circumstances mentioned above, it is humbly prayed that by accepting this writ petition, an appropriate writ in favour of the petitioner and against the non-petitioners may very kindly be issued by declaring the proceedings of allotment dated 7-9-2002, 16-12-1997 and transfer order dated 24-9-2002 readjustment of all the proceedings of non-petitioners for readjustment allotment of plot No. 164-B/3 at the place of plot No. 163-C Sub-Sector F-3 Part III Mirpur and revising order of plot No. 164-B-3 Sector F-3 part III Mirpur No./CRA/5814-15/2011 dated 22-3-2011 are against the law, without lawful authority and be quashed derogatory to the MDA Act 1974. The impugned order of non-petitioners dated 25-2-2011 regarding Plot No. 164-B/3 sub-sector F/3, part III, Mirpur, measuring 1 kanal allotment dated 7-9-2002, 16-12-1997 and transfer order of the said plot dated 24-9-2002 in favour of non-petitioner No.11, 12 and revising order of Plot No. 164-B-3 sector F-3, part III, Mirpur No/CRA/5814-15/2011 dated 22-3-2011 may also very kindly be set aside by restraining them to readjustment of Plot No.164/B-3 at the place of Plot No. 163-C sub-sector F-3, part III, Mirpur, measuring 10 marlas in accordance with sector plan, all the proceedings of non-petitioners for allotment and transfer for readjustment of plot No. 164-B/3 at the place of plot No.163-C Sub-sector F-3, part III, Mirpur and revising order of Plot No.164 B-3 sector F-3, part III, Mirpur No./CRA/5814-15/2011 dated 22-3-2011 are against the law, without lawful authority and be quashed. Any other relief which this Hon''ble Court deems fit may also very kindly be granted to the petitioner.""\n\nAfter going through the above prayer clauses made in the plaint and writ petition, it reveals that almost the same relief has been claimed in the civil suit and in the writ petition filed after the institution of the civil suit.\n\n6. For resolution of the point regarding the maintainability of writ petition section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974 is relevant, which is reproduced herein below as under:--\n\n ""44. Jurisdiction of High Court.--\n\n(1) The High Court shall have such jurisdiction as is conferred on it by this Act or by any other law.\n\n(2) Subject to this Act, the High Court, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law-\n\n(a) on the application of any aggrieved party, make an order?\n\n(i) directing a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of Azad Jammu and Kashmir or local authority to refrain from doing that which he is not permitted by law to do, or to do that which he is required by law to do; or \n\n(ii) declaring that any act done or proceedings taken by a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of the State or a local authority has been done or taken without lawful authority, and is of no legal effect; or\n\n(b) on the application of any person, make an order?\n\n(i) directing that a person in custody in Azad Jammu and Kashmir be brought before the High Court so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without lawful authority or in an unlawful manner; or\n\n(ii) requiring a person holding or purporting to hold a public office (in connection with the affairs of Azad Jammu and Kashmir) to show under what authority of law he claims to hold that office; or\n\n(c) on the application of any aggrieved person, make an order giving such directions to the person or authority, including the Council and the Government, exercising any power or performing any function in, or in relation to, Azad Jammu and Kashmir as may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred by this Act,\n\n(3) ……………………………………………………………………………\n\n(4) ……………………………………………………………………………\n\n(a) ……………………………………………………………………………\n\n(b) ……………………………………………………………………………\n\n(5) ……………………………………………………………………………\n\nThe opening words of section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, in subsection (2) provide that ''subject to this Act, the High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law.'' After bare reading"" of the above said Constitutional provision, it is spelt out that the Constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court can only be invoked when there is no other remedy available. In the present case, it is admitted position that the respondent No.1 has already availed the remedy by filing the suit before the Court of competent jurisdiction, which is pending, therefore, the argument advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant that two remedies cannot be availed simultaneously at different fora has substance and in our estimation after filing the suit with the same relief, which has been claimed before the High Court in the writ petition, the writ petition was not competent, therefore, the same has incompetently been filed before the. High Court. Reliance is placed on the case reported as Ch. Jan Muhammad v. Ch. Muhammad Ismail and 6 others (2000 YLR 1051), wherein it has been observed as under:--\n\n ""5. We have given due consideration to the arguments raised at the Bar. Needless to say that the relief in writ jurisdiction is discretionary one; the writ jurisdiction can be invoked only in the circumstances indicated in the relevant provisions of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974. It is well settled principle of law that if a civil suit is pending between the parties, none of the parties is legally competent to agitate the matter before the High Court during the pendency of suit; if the civil suit and writ petition are heard simultaneously, that is likely to result in contradictory findings by the Courts. \n\n7. Even otherwise, the contents of the writ petition and the plaint reveal that both the parties are claiming their respective plots situated at the one and the same place. One is claiming that he purchased the plot measuring 1 kanal, whereas, the other is claiming that he purchased plot measuring 10 marlas situated on the same place. Such like controversy cannot be resolved in the writ petition without recording the evidence, which is not the job of the High Court while exercising the powers under section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974. It is well settled principle on the subject that the factual controversy cannon be resolved in the writ jurisdiction as has been laid down in a case reported as The Eastern Construction Company v. AJ&K Government and others [2013 SCR 548], wherein it has been observed as under:--\n\n ""6. After going through the contents of the writ petitions and the appeal, we are of the view that the questions agitated before the High Court pertain to factual controversy which can only be resolved after recording evidence which is not the job of the High Court...."" \n\n In another case titled Capt. Rtd. Ali Afsar Khan v. Khalid Mahmood [2007 SCR 263] in which it has been held by this Court as under:--\n\n ""The above narrated detail reveals that the controversy between the parties is purely in respect of controversial points of facts which in view of law cannot be inquired into in exercise of writ jurisdiction under section 44 of the AJ&K Interim Constitution Act, 1974. Similarly very strong, grounds are required along with a statutory backing to look into the validity or otherwise of the finding recorded by a Tribunal of exclusive jurisdiction.""\n\n8. The existence of another adequate remedy is such rule of law which ousts the jurisdiction of the High Court. The extraordinary jurisdiction under section 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, cannot be invoked when alternate remedy under law is available to an aggrieved party. It may be observed that according to law, the alternate remedy must be adequate, efficacious, convenient, beneficial, speedy and effective. Where the Court thinks proper that the order impugned in the writ petition is without jurisdiction and unlawful, there would be no bar on filing a writ petition and the Court would not hesitate in entertaining the Constitutional petition although alternate remedy is available. Reliance can be placed in a case reported as Dr.Liaqat Ali Khan and another v. District Returning Officer, District Sargodha and 3 others [2002 SCMR 1632], wherein it has been observed as under:--\n\n ""The remedy of election petition provided under the Punjab Local Government Elections Rules, 2000 is available to a contesting candidate after issuance of the notification of result of returned candidate but no such petition can be filed by a person who is not a contesting candidate in the election. The petitioners being no more contesting candidates in the runoff election, would not be in a position to challenge the election of returned candidate through an election petition. Undoubtedly, the Tribunal on the basis of grounds mentioned in Rule 83 of the Rules, can declare an election as a whole to be void. Under the above rule, the Tribunal can exercise power only to an election petition which is filed by a contesting candidate and the petitioners being the contesting candidates in runoff election would not be in a position to avail such remedy against returned candidate, and therefore, they had rightly invoked the Constitution jurisdiction of High Court for redressal of their grievance. It would not be out of place to mention here that even if the statutory remedy available under the law is considered inadequate and inefficacious as the relief being claimed cannot be granted to an aggrieved person in such remedy, the writ petition can be maintained.""\n\n9. The Constitution imposes a condition precedent to be met before invoking special jurisdiction of the High Court that the High Court must be satisfied that the aggrieved person has no other adequate remedy under law to redress his grievance and on such satisfaction it has to embark upon to exercise its jurisdiction, whereas, in this case, admittedly, the respondents have already availed the alternate remedy in the form of civil suit. Reliance can be placed in a case reported as Ghulam Hussain and 3 others v. Muhammad Bostan and 3 others [PLD 1995 SC (AJ&K) 38], it was observed as under:--\n\n ""7. The High Court has observed that it cannot be termed that the order is without jurisdiction. On the present record it is not possible to disagree with the High Court. The case cited by Ch.Muhammad Riaz Alam, namely, Muhammad Ismail v. Income Tax Officer (1993 SCR 370) supports him. It was held that there is a distinction between total absence of jurisdiction and violation of law.\n\n 8. Even if the contention of Mr. Muhammad Yunus Arvi is accepted a writ petition would be incompetent. This Court has held in Abdul Rehman v. Income Tax Officer (1993 SCR 186) that existence of an adequate remedy is a rule of law barring jurisdiction of the Court and it is not regulatory in nature. It was also held that the High Court can only entertain a writ petition if it finds that alternative remedy is not adequate…..""\n\n10. There was no occasion for the High Court to admit the writ petition for regular hearing as disputed questions of the facts cannot be resolved in a writ petition as laid down in a case reported as Azad Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir through Chief Secretary and 6 others v. Khasmir Steel and Re-Rolling Mills through Managing Director and 3 others [2005 YLR 1834], it was observed as under:--\n\n ""13. The disputed questions of fact were raised by the respondent in the writ petition which, as said earlier, could not be resolved without the evidence and detailed inquiry. This point stands settled that questions of fact could not be resolved in exercise of writ jurisdiction by the High Court, unless the facts are admitted from both sides\n\n11. As in para 4 of the memo of appeal, the appellant has stated that in the same matter and between the same parties, the civil suit is already pending which was filed prior to the institution of the writ petition. However, in the prayer clause, the learned counsel has only prayed for setting aside the impugned order dated 8-5-2012. As we have held in the preceding para that a civil suit regarding the same matter is sub judice before the Court of competent jurisdiction and the question raised in the writ petition involved factual controversy, which can only be resolved after recording the evidence, which is not the job of the High Court in writ jurisdiction, therefore, the writ petition is not maintainable.\n\nResultantly, this appeal is accepted while setting aside the impugned order of the High Court dated 8-5-2012. Consequently, the writ petition filed in the High Court is hereby dismissed with no order as to costs.\n\nAppeal allowed.\n \n\n"\n', 'PLD 1973 Supreme Court 236,1994 MLD 2382,1995 MLD 2382,1995 SCR 283,1996 SCR 283,2007 SCR 155,2008 SCR 155,2013 SCR 548,2014 SCR 548,2007 SCR 263,2008 SCR 263,2002 SCMR 1632,2003 SCMR 1632,PLD 1995 SC (AJ&K) 38,1993 SCR 370,1993 SCR 186,1994 SCR 186,2005 YLR 1834,2006 YLR 1834,2000 YLR 1051,1998 SCMR 516,1999 SCMR 516', 'PLD-2015-Supreme-Court(AJ-K)-7.pdf'),

The sentence was further confirmed by the Confirming Authority vide Promulgation Certificate dated 15-4-2011.\n2. The petitioner has challenged his above mentioned conviction and sentence through this writ petition on the grounds that at the time of his trial by the FGCM the petitioner was not subject of Pakistan Air Force Act, 1953 as provided under section 3 ibid; that under Rule 14 of the Pakistan Air Force Rules, 1957 the petitioner has already been retired from service w.e.f. 5-7-2009; that as the petitioner has already been retired, therefore; he was not liable to be tried by FGCM. Hence, the writ petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 was maintainable as bar under clause (3) of the said Article is not absolute as the Tribunal/FGCM did not have the jurisdiction to try the alleged offences against the petitioner, therefore, this writ petition was maintainable.\n3. Learned counsel for the petitioner during arguments reiterated the  stand  as  mentioned  in  the  writ  petition. He  argued  that  under Article 4 of the Constitution it was a right of an individual that he be dealt with in accordance with law and as the petitioner was not subject of Pakistan Air Force, therefore, his trial and subsequent conviction was liable to be set aside as the same was passed without any lawful justification by a Tribunal having no jurisdiction. In :support of his contentions reliance has been placed on Muhammad  Akram Khan v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan through  Secretary to the Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Law and Parliamentary Affairs, Islamabad and  another (PLD 1969 SC 174), The  State v. Zia-ur-Rehman and others (PLD 1973 SC 49), Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Establishment Division,  Government of Pakistan v. Saeed Ahmad Khan and  others (PLD 1960 SC 266), Brig. Retd.

Federation of Pakistan and  others (PLD 2009 SC 866) and Muhammad Azhar Siddique and another v. Government of Punjab  through Chief Secretary, Lahore and 18 others (PLD 2010 Lahore 138).\n4. Contrary to this, learned standing counsel opposed this writ petition on the grounds that this writ petition was not maintainable under Article 199(3) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. It was further agitated that appeal under section 162(13) of Pakistan Air Force Act, 1953 was available with the petitioner which remedy he did not avail, hence, this Constitutional petition is not maintainable. On factual side it was agitated that a fair trial was conducted and as the petitioner was found guilty, therefore, he was rightly convicted and sentenced by FGCM. While relying on Mushtaq Ahmed and others v. Secretary, Ministry of Defence through Chief of Air and Army Staff and  others (PLD 2007 SC 405) prayed that this writ petition be dismissed on the point of maintainability.\n5. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.\n6. The main stance of the learned counsel for the petitioner right from the beginning was that petitioner had already been retired from service with effect from 5-7-2009, therefore, he was not subject of Pakistan Air Force and he could have not been charged and tried by the FGCM. In order to appreciate the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the petitioner it is appropriate to reproduce section 2 of Pakistan Air Force Act, 1953 which provides---\n ""2. Persons subject to this Act.-The following persons shall be subject to this Act wherever they may be, namely:--\n(a) officers and warrant officers of the Air Force;\n(b) persons enrolled under the Indian Air Force Act, 1932 before the date notified in pursuance of subsection (2) of section 1 and serving in the Air Force on that date, and persons enrolled under this Act;\n(c) persons belonging to the Pakistan Air Force Reserves in the circumstances prescribed by rules made under section 6 of the Pakistan (Army and Air Force) Reserves Act, 1950 (XLVII of 1950);\n(d) persons not otherwise subject to Air Force law who on active service, in camp, on the march, or at any frontier post specified by the Federal Government, by notification in this behalf are employed by, or are in the service of or, are followers of or accompany any portion of the Air Force.""\n7. Section 3 provides the termination of application of the Act which reads as under:--\n ""3. Termination of application of the Act.--Every person subject to this Act under clauses (a) to (c) of section 2 shall remain so subject until duly retired, discharged, released, removed  or  dismissed  from  service  and  every  persons subject  to  this  Act  under  clause  (e)  of  section  2  shall remain so subject during the period of his secondment to the Air Force.\n8. According to the learned counsel the petitioner was retired from Pakistan Air Force Service with effect from 5-7-2009 which was the date of strike of duty (SOD). Rule 14 of Pakistan Air Force Act Rules, 1957 provides  the  effective  date  of  dismissal,  removal,  etc.  it  reads as under:--\n""14. Effective date of dismissal, removal, etc.--The Federal Government may when authorizing the dismissal, removal, termination of commission, release or retirement of an officer, specify any further date from which it shall take effect; provided that when no such date is specified the dismissal, removal, termination of commission, release or retirement, shall take effect from the date on which it was duly authorized, or from the date on which the officer concerned ceased to perform air force duty, whichever is the later date.""\nRule 12 provides the procedure whereby the authority is empowered to pass order regarding dismissal, removal retirement or release, etc. of an officer. Under sub-rule (2) of section 12 it is specifically provided that for the purpose of section 3 of the Act an officer shall be deemed duly retired, released, removed or dismissed from the service, if his retirement, release, removal or dismissal from the service has been notified in the Official Gazette. Under Note-2 annexed to the Rule 12 it has specifically been mentioned that unless the dismissal or removal, etc. has been notified in the Official Gazette, the officer will continue to be subject to this Act.\n9. If the para-wise comments submitted by the respondent are seen a letter dated 21-7-2009 at page-16 (Annexure-C) issued on behalf of Deputy Chief of Air Staff (Per) Air Headquarters, Peshawar is annexed. The contents of which are as under:--\n ""Please refer to Air HQrs letter No.Air HQ/12312/ 8413/Mng/ PB dated 22-6-2009 respecting GP CAPT S.M. FAZAL, PAK/8413 A7SD.\n The particulars of his LPR are as:\n (a)  Date of Struck of Duty (SOD)   5-7-2009\n (b)  Service Leave      365 days\n (c)  Furlough      ____days\n (d)  Date to be Struck of Strength (SOS)  4-7-2010""\n10. According to the above mentioned letter the date to be struck of strength (SOS) was shown as 4-7-2010 whereas date of struck of duty (SOD) was shown as 5-7-2009 and service leave was shown as 365-days. The petitioner although his date of struck of duty was 5-7-2009 but was on LPR of 365-days when he was asked to appear before the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) and then he was charge sheeted meaning thereby that he was at the time of the trial was subject to Pakistan Air Force and was liable to be charged and tried accordingly. Admittedly under section 162-B of the Pakistan Air Force Act, 1953 right to appeal has been provided to the petitioner which fact has further elaborated at the time of confirmation of his sentence through promulgation certificate which is placed on record of this petition by the petitioner himself as Annexure-Q. Relevant paragraph of the same is reproduced as under:--\n ''You are apprised that under the provisions of PAF Act Section 162-B, you have a right to file an appeal (if applicable) against the findings and sentence of the said FGCM to the Court of Appeals  as  per  the  procedure as mentioned in Chapter XII, (Rules 249 to 284) of the PAF Act Rules within thirty days from the date of promulgation.""\n11. The petitioner did not avail the remedy of appeal provided under the relevant provision of law and even otherwise under Article 199(3) of the Constitution there is a bar. For facility of reference the same is reproduced:--\n ""An order shall not be made under clause (1) on application made by or in relation to a person who is member of the Armed Forces of Pakistan, or who is for the time being subject to any law relating to any of those Forces, in respect of his terms . and conditions of service, in respect of any matter arising out of his service, or in respect of any action taken in relation to him as a member of the Armed Forces of Pakistan or as a person subject to such law.\n12.

Brief  facts  are  that  the  petitioner  is  a  company  engaged  in construction business. The petitioner and respondent No.2 entered into a time bound contract agreement dated 17.06.2010 (Contract) for the construction and maintenance work of Emergency Services Academy at Thokar Niaz Baig, Lahore. Despite two extensions granted, the work under contract could not be completed within time. The petitioner filed a suit  on  02.04.2012  for  declaration  and  permanent  injunction  on  the ground that it is the respondent No.2, who breached the contract by not releasing th 15.05.2012 along with forfeiture of performance guarantee submitted by the petitioner. Respondent No.2 vide letter dated 31.10.2012 also blacklisted  the  petitioner company  for  a  period of 3 years  from participating in future tendering in the Province of Punjab. The petitioner being aggrieved previously filed W.P.No.475/2013. The matter came up for hearing on 11.02.2014, when with the consent of the parties, the impugned order was set aside and the matter was remanded to the authority with direction to give hearing to the petitioner and pass a speaking order after recording contentions of the petitioner. After remand of case, respondent No.2 passed order dated 04.04.2014 whereby the petitioner was again blacklisted for a term of 3 years; hence, this Constitutional petition.\n\n3.       The learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the impugned order of blacklisting has been passed under Rule 19 of the Punjab Procurement Rules, 2009 (“PPRA, 2009”). Submits that under Rule 19 of PPRA, 2009, a period of three years on 31.10.2012 and after remand of the case by this Court on 11.02.2014 with consent of parties, the respondent No.2 without excluding the matter is already pending, as to who was in breach of the contract. Submits unless default is \n50 years and more than 8000 employees, the blacklisting of the petitioner will entail serious consequences of commercial killing of the company besides attaching stigma to the company and its management, therefore, the impugned order amounts to violation of Article 4, 9, 18 and 10 A of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. Adds that the impugned order of blacklisting is not under the terms and conditions of contract but under the PPRA 2009, therefore, the arbitration is not an adequate alternative remedy available to the petitioner and this petition is maintainable. Submits that in any case, respondent No.2 does not figure anywhere in the contract, therefore, he is not a competent authority to blacklist the petitioner under the contract. Concludes that in any case, the petitioner was never in default of his performance previously, therefore, it cannot be said that there is consistent failure of performance on part of the petitioner under PPRA 2009 for passing orders of blacklisting of Petitioner   Company.   Submits   that   the   punishment   is   also   not proportionate to the alleged default. Reliance is placed on  Atlas Cables Pvt. Ltd. vs. Quetta Electric Supply Company Ltd. (PLD 2011 Quetta 67);    Canara Bank, Plaintiff v. M/s. Studywell and others (AIR 1994 Delhi 308);  Bhim Sain, petitioner v. Union of India and another   (AIR 1981 Delhi 260) and  Tristar Shipping Lines Limited v. Government of Pakistan   etc.   (1997   CLC   1475).   In   response   to   question   of maintainability of  the  petition  against  the  Government  of  Punjab,  he submits that the main grievance of the petitioner being against respondent No.2, who is a statutory body, this petition is maintainable against respondent No.2 and not hit by the provision of Section 79 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (CPC) and Article 174 of the Constitution  of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (Constitution).\n\n4.       Conversely, for the respondents, the learned Addl. A.Gs. assisted by the learned Assistant Advocate General raised preliminary objection on the maintainability of this petition, on the ground that the Government of Punjab being not sued through Province of Punjab, this writ petition is not maintainable under Section 79 of CPC read with Article 174 of the Constitution. Reliance is placed on the case reported  as   Hafiz  Ikram Saeed   vs   State   (2013   SCMR   1045); Government of Balochistan CWPP&H  Department  and  others  v.  Nawabzada  Mir  Tariq  Hussain Khan Magsi and others (2009 SCMR 115), Haji Abdul Aziz vs. Government of Balochistan through Deputy Commissioner, Khuzdar (1999 SCMR 16),  Province of the Punjab through Member Board of Revenue Lahore and others vs. Muhammad Hussain through Legal Heirs and others (PLD 1993 SC 147),  Deputy Commissioner/Registrar, Sialkot and 2 others vs. Hamid Khalidi and 4 others  (1987 CLC 2360). Adds that this petition is also not maintainable being disputed question of fact is involved and having alternate remedy available under the PPRA, 2009 and  also  being  remedy  of  arbitration  available  under  the  contract. Reliance is placed on the cases reported as  Abdul Qayyum Khan vs. Government  of  Punjab,  L.G.  and  Rural  Development     Department through Secretary and another (PLD 2003 SC 536),  Mumtaz Ahmad vs. Zila Council, Sahiwal through Administrator and others (1999 SCMR 117),  Messrs Airport Support Services vs. The Airport Managber, Quaid- eE-Azam International Airport, Karachi and others (1998 SCMR 2268), Sabir Rehman vs. Secretary to Government of NWFP Forestry, Fisheries, Wildlife Department at Civil Secretariat, Peshawar and 7 others (2002 CLC 1446),  Syed Bhais Pvt. Ltd. through Director vs. Government ofPunjab through Secretary Local Government and 3 others (PLD 2012 Lah 52)  and Syed Wajahat Ali vs. Govt. of KPK through Secretaries Industries and 3 others (2013 YLR 2132). On merits, it is argued that the impugned order is well reasoned, and also fulfills the requirements of rule of natural justice. Contends that the petitioner failed to perform the contract within time agreed, hence caused loss of Rs.238.470 million to the public exchequer. Adds that blacklisting of the petitioner for a period of three years is commensurate with the loss to the public exchequer.\n\n5.      I have given my anxious consideration to the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with their able assistance.\n\n6.       The close scrutiny of record shows that petitioner entered into a contract   agreement   dated   17.06.2010   for   the   construction   and maintenance work of Emergency Academy services at Thokar Niaz Baig, Lahore. The project contract could not be completed within time, despite extensions, therefore, the same was rescinded on 15.05.2012 along with forfeiture  of  security  amount.  The  respondent  No.2  vide  order  dated\n31.10.2012, also blacklisted the petitioner and forbidden it to participate in the future tendering in the Province of Punjab. The petitioner being aggrieved, filed W.P.No.475/2013, which was disposed of with the consent of the parties on 11.02.2014 in terms that the impugned order\n\n7.       Admittedly, the contract between the parties is dated 17.06.2010, therefore, the procurement rules applicable in the present case is PPRA,\n2009. The Blacklisting of Supplier and Contractors is provided under\n\nRule 19 of PPRA 2009, which is reproduced hereunder:\n“Blacklisting  of  suppliers  and contractors.- The procuring agencies shall specify a mechanism and manner to permanently or temporarily bar, from participating in their respective procurement proceedings, suppliers and contractors who either consistently fail to provide satisfactory performances or are found to be indulging in corrupt or fraudulent practices. Such Barring action shall be duly publicized and communicated to the PPRA:\nProvided  that  any  supplier  or  contractor who is to be blacklisted shall be accorded adequate opportunity of being heard.\n\nThe bare perusal of Rule 19 ibid shows that other than providing adequate opportunity of  hearing,  the  procuring  agency is  required  to specify a mechanism  and manner to permanently or temporarily bar the supplier and contractor from participating in their respective procurement proceedings who consistently fail to provide satisfactory performance Similar provision also exists under Rule 21 of the Punjab Procurement Rules, 2014.(PPRA, 2014).\n\n8.       The words “mechanism” and “manner” are not defined in PPRA 2009, therefore, ordinary dictionary meaning of these words will be relevant. The Word “mechanism” in Oxford dictionary New 8th Edition is defined as “a method or a system for achieving”  “mechanism for dealing with complaints from the general public”. Similarly word “manner” is defined in Oxford dictionary New 8th Edition is “the way that something is done or happens”. The ordinary dictionary meaning of these words denotes that procuring agency is required to prescribe method and system for dealing with complaints against contractors and suppliers for their temporary and permanent blacklisting.\n\n9.      This fact is not disputed by the respondents that till date no “mechanism” and “manner” under Rule 19 of PPRA, 2009 has been specified by respondent No.2 for blacklisting any \ncontext reliance is placed on  M/s. V.N. Lakhani and Co. vs. M.V.Lakhotoi Express and others (PLD 1994 SC 894) and Mh Aslam vs. Land Acqusition Collector  (1994 MLD 1340). The blacklisting of a contractor or supplier under Rule 19 of PPRA 2009, would entail serious consequences of forbidding the contractor/supplier from participating in the future tendering, which will not only result in deprivation from its business  activities  but  will  amount  to     commercial  killing  of  the company. Blacklisting will also tarnish its reputation, credibility and honour in the business community. Therefore, such disaster step of blacklisting of contractor/supplier  cannot  be  resorted  to  without observing fair trial and due process of law as envisaged in Article 4 and 10-A of the Constitution. The word “mechanism” and “manner” used in Rule 19 ibid are not meaningless rather it denote due process and fair procedure which include adjudication by impartial and independent authority, prescribing fair criteria, proportionate duration of punishment and structuring of discretion of the authorities exercising power of blacklisting. The word “shall” used in Rule 19 ibid also makes it mandatory and obligatory for the Procuring agency to provide such fair and transparent mechanism and manner of Blacklisting. It is settled law that  act  should  be  done  accordingly  to  relevant  rules  or  not  at  all. Reliance  is  placed  on     Syed  Abdul  Aziz  Nasir  Haqani  vs.  R.O.  for Presidential Election (Chief Election Commissioner) Islamabad (1994\nCLC 648) and  Muhammad Siddique Farooqi vs. Azad Jammu Kashmir Government through its Chief Secretary Muzaffarabad and others (1994 (AJK) PSC 218) and  Salahuddin and 7 others vs. Bibi Zubaida and\nothers (1994 MLD 2464).\n\n10.     As consequences of blacklisting a person are of great magnitude, it warrant that before taking such action there should be a fair and proper trial through   an impartial Court or Tribunal by providing such person reasonable opportunity to defend the allegations made against the person. This Court in  Messrs Yousaf Sugar Mills vs. Trust Leasing Corporation and others (2006 CLD 1191) while dealing with matter of blacklisting of a company held as under:-\n“The preventing a company from the privilege and advantages of entering into a lawful relationship  with  the  bank  for  the  purpose  of Article 18 of the Constitution. The consequences of blacklisting a person are of great magnitude and warrant  that  before  taking  such  action  there should be a fair and proper trial, through an impartial Court or Tribunal by providing such person   defend the allegations made against him. The effect of placement of a person’s  name on  the list that facility of finance is extended to such person, only after recording reasons, according to para 2(a)(ii) of the prudential Regulations. It has the effect of negating the facility to a borrower in the ordinary course. If the name of a person is bought on the list without any verification, it will adversely effect the reputation as well as the business   of   such   borrower.   The   Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “New Jubilee Insurance Corporation v. National Bank of Pakistan Karachi” PLD 1999 SC 1126, held that when an act or order inflicts civil consequences on a person in respect of his reputation or property which is harmful to his interest, he is entitled to be heard before such an action or order is taken or passed.   It   will   be   appropriate   to   reproduce relevant part of the judgment:-\n\n“It  may be pointed  out  thus  the fall  out  of  the blacklisting of the appellant is to prevent it from the privilege and advantage of entering into lawful relationship with the respondent for the purpose of gains which is violative of Article 18 of the Constitution, which lays down that subject to such qualifications, if any, as may be prescribed by law, every citizen shall have the right to enter upon any lawful profession or any lawful trade or business. The blacklisting of a company/firm/person, tarnishes the reputation of it/has, as to its/his credibility to honour its/his commitments which may dissuade other parties from entering into contracts  which  warrant  that  before  taking  such  an action, there should be material on record prima facie to indicate that the delinquent Insurance Company’s refusal to pay claim was not warranted in the circumstances of the case.”\n\nIn this regard reliance is also placed on New Jubilee Insurance Corporation vs. NBP Karachi  (PLD 1999 SC 1126),  Messrs M.A. Aleem Khan through Chairman vs Province of the Punjab (PLD 2006 Lah 84), Messrs Nizami Construction Company vs Chief Executive Officer, Gujranwala   (2005  CLC  366),   Messrs  Al-Noor  Construction  Co.  vs Cantonment Board Peshawar(2004 CLC 1647), The Crescent Star Insurance Co Limited vs National Bank of Pakistan (2002 CLD 433), Tristar Shipping Lines Limited vs Government of Pakistan (1997 CLC\n1475),  Messrs Rajput Builders and others vs National Security Insurance Co.(1992  CLC  818)  and   Atlas  Cables  (PVT)  Ltd  vs  Quetta  Electric Supply  Company  Ltd  (PLD  2011  Quetta  67),   Arian  Equipment  and Chemicals Ltd. vs. State of West Bengal and others (AIR 1975 SC 266) \n\nM/s V.K Dewan and Co. Vs. Municipal Corporation of Dehli and others (AIR 1994 Delhi 304) and Pretam Pipes Syndicate   vs. Tamal Nado (AIR 1986 Mad 310).\n\n11.     The order of respondent No.2 without specifying any “mechanism” and “manner” under Rule 19 ibid also amounts to exercise of discretion in unbridled and unstructured manner. The discretion with the authority, without a uniform yardstick or formula is a loose jumble of haphazard human subjectivity, which is inescapably susceptible to error, arbitrary, exfacie discriminatory, highly irrational and illogical decisions. The administrative compulsion and wisdom to structure discretion as in Rule\n19 ibid is to remove human subjectivity from exercise of discretion. Constitutional and jurisprudential importance of structured discretion is that it nursed the requirement of due process, fairness and fair trial and safeguards the unbridled discretion against voice of discrimination and arbitrariness. In this context reliance is placed on Muhammad Ashraf Tiwana and others vs. Pakistan and others (2013 SCMR 1159). The Division  Bench  of  this  Court  in   Tanveer  Ahmad  Khan  vs. Registrar Lahorel High Court Lahore and 3 others (PLD 2013 Lah 386) while dealing with a question of structuring of discretion held as under:\n“The need to have intelligent objective criteria or smart parameters, therefore, cannot be over emphasized. Such criteria   or   parameters   are   tools   for   the   selecting authority to logically fashion its discretion. Reliance is placed on Tariq Aziz-ud Din and others ( 2010 SCMR 1301)  Corruption  in Haji Arrangements in 2010 (PLD 2011  SC  963).  Muhammad  Yasin  v.  Federation  of\nPakistan through Secretary, Establishment Davison, Islamabadf  and  others  (PLD  2012  SC  132).   Messrs Gadoon Textile Mills and 814 others vs WAPDA and others    (1997   SCMR   641)    and   Muhammad   Iqbal Khokhar  and  3  others  vs.    The  Government  of  the Punjab, through the Secretary to Government of the Punjab, Lahore and 2 others (PLD 1991 SC 35).  On the concept of  institutional discretion, this Court has held in Liaqat Ali Chugtai v.Federation of Pakistan through Secretary  Railways  and  6  others  (2012  PLC  (C.S.) 1062): \n……On an institutional level, structuring the discretion is to protect the institution and the public from the vice of arbitrariness. It is to filter whims, vagaries, caprice, surmises and volatility attached to human behavior, translated into human dissection. These vices are a breeding ground for corruption, nepotism   and   favourtism.   These   vices   are   like termites and if permitted to exist. Weaken the foundations of democratic public institutions. Reference at this stage is made to the case of   Aman Ullah Khanf and others vs. The Federal Government of Pakistan   through   Secretary,   Ministry   of   Fifnance, Islamabad  and  others  (PLD  1990  SC  1092  at  page\n1147, relevant part of para 62 reads as under:-\n“Wherever wide-worded powers conferring discretion exist,  there  remains  always  the need  to  structure the\ndiscretion   and   it   has   been   pointed   out   in   the\nAdministrative Law Text by Kenneth Culp Davis that the structuring of discretion only means regularizing it, organizing it, producing order in it so that decision will achieve the high quality of justice.    The seven instruments that are most useful in the structuring of discretionary power are open plans, open policy statements, open rules, open findings, open reasons, open precedents and fair informal procedure. Somehow, in our context, the wide worded conferment of discretionary powers or reservation of discretion without framing rules to regulate its exercise, has been taken to be an enhancement of the power and it gives that impression in the first instance but where the authorities  fail to rationalize it and regulate it by Rules, or Policy statements or precedents the Courts have to intervene more often, than is necessary, apart from the exercise of such power appearing Arbitrary, and capricious at times.”\n\nThe above principles have been consistently reiterated in the cases of Chairman, regional Transport Authority, Rawalpindi v. Pakistan Mutual Insurance Company Limited Rawalpindi (PLD1991 SC 14)  Director Food, N-W.F.P and another v. Messrs Madina Flour and General Mills (Pvt)  Ltd and 18 others (PLD 2001 SC 1)  Chief Secretary Punjab and others v. Abdul Raoof Dasti, (2006 SCMR 1876),  Abdul Wahab and another v. Secretary, Government of Balochistan and another  (2009 SCMR 1354)  and Delhi Trnsport Corporation v D.T.C. Mazdoor Congress and others (AIR 1991 SC 101)\n quirement of mechanism and manner under rule ibid, the impugned order dated 04.04.2014 is arbitrary or  not. As discussed below, I have no manner of doubt that the impugned order is completely arbitrary. Earlier, in Writ Petition No.475/2013 the case was remanded with consent of the parties, with specific direction that speaking order  be  passed  after  considering  the  contentions  of  the  petitioner.  The record shows that the petitioner, inter alia, specifically raised objections that no rules have been framed under Rule 19 of the PPRA, 2009 for blacklisting the petitioner, therefore, no blacklisting order can be passed. This contention was also raised through a written application before respondent No.2, which is also placed on record of this petition. This contention of the petitioner was neither recorded nor considered or decided in the impugned order despite order of this Court dated 11.02.2014. I have also noted that the petitioner was initially blacklisted for a period of three years on 31.10.2012 and remained blacklisted for almost 16 months till date when the case was remanded with consent of parties on 11.02.2014. On remand while passing the impugned order dated 04.04.2014 the period during which the petitioner already remained blacklisted was not excluded and  petitioner was again blacklisted for another period of three years, which amounts to double jeopardy in clear violation of Article 13 of the Constitution. The respondent tried to argue that further three years blacklisting commensurate with loss caused to exchequer, this ground is misconceived, as according to rule 19 ibid the blacklisting is based on failure to perform and not amount of loss unilaterally determined by the respondent No.2. Even otherwise the respondent No.2 is neither a competent authority under the contract to determine the loss on the part of the petitioner nor to penalize it for such loss under the contract. The finding of respondent No.2 to unilaterally determine the loss and then also penalize the petitioner for such loss, makes respondent No.2 a judge of its own cause,  especially when the matter is still pending before the Civil Court and admittedly none of the parties have invoked the arbitration clause/proceeding for the determination of   their respective liability.  Further  as  per  Rule  19  of  PPRA,  2009  a  contractor  can  be blacklisted who has consistently failed to provide satisfactory performance. This fact is not disputed between the parties that prior to the contract in question dated 17.06.2010, the petitioner have not defaulted in any other previous contract relating to the respondents. cribed in PPRA, 2009 for blacklisting the contractor, therefore, in the absence of any time period under the rules, the blacklisting of the petitioner company for a fresh term of three years is not only arbitrary but also without lawful authority. The learned Law Officers tried to justify the impugned order dated 04.04.2014 on the ground that the time period is prescribed under the purchase manual. I am afraid this arguments is misconceived as neither in the contract nor under the PPRA, 2009 purchase manual has made applicable to the petitioner. In any case once PPRA, 2009 was promulgated which specifically provide provision for blacklisting  of  suppliers  and  contractors,  the  conflicting  provision  of purchase manual are deemed to be repealed and cannot be applied. Reliance is placed on  M/s. Tank Steel and Re-Rolling Mills Pvt. Ltd. Dera Ismial Khan and others vs. F.O.P etc. (PLD 1996 SC 77) and  Muhammad Yousaf Ali Shah vs. Federal Land Commissioner Govt. of Pakistan Rawalpindi and two others  (1995 CLC 369). Further it is settled law that officer exercising power under a statute, should follow it strictly and cannot borrow the provision from other statute. Reliance is placed on  Mst. Ayesha Bibi vs. Nazir Ahmed and 10 others  (1994 SCMR 1935). At this juncture, it is also pragmatic to refer the letter dated 07.03.2013 written by the Republic Engineering Corporation (PVT) Ltd. (the Engineer under the Contract) to respondent No.2 in response to its query  dated 06.03.2013 for blacklisting the petitioner. For facility, the relevant extract of the aforenoted letter is reproduced below:-\n“Please note that the Contract has been rescinded as per Clause-60 under the instructions of   Project   Steering  Committee.  The  referred clause   was   invoked   after   fulfilling   all   the contractual requirements. However, there is no provision for blacklisting of the Contractor in the Contract’.\n\nIn the aforesaid letter it was specifically advised by the Engineer, that there is no provision of blacklisting of the contractor in the contract but said opinion was ignored while passing the impugned order. The perusal of  the  impugned  order  also  shows  that  despite  the  fact  that  the petitioner’s  contract  is  of  year  2010  and  its  previous  blacklisting  on 31.10.2012 was also under PPRA, 2009, therefore, after the remand, the petitioner’s case was required to be decided as per the law applicable at the  relevant  time  i.e.  PPRA, 2009,  but  the  respondent  No.2  applied PPRA, 2014, without any reasoning and lawful justification. It is well settled principle of law that where law is amended during pendency of an action, case is required to be decided under old law unless specifically provided in the amended law. Reliance is placed on  Khudadai Dad alias Mama and others vs State and others(PLD 1997 Quetta 69) and Muhammad Sarwar Khan vs Muhammad Azam Khan and others(1997 CLC 500). No doubt, the petitioner was given hearing by the respondent No.2  before  passing  the  impugned  order  but  the  principle of natural justice must be followed not merely as a formality but as a well-meaning and effective requirement of law, which includes passing of a speaking and well-reasoned order as mandated under Section 24 A of the General Clauses Act, 1897. In view of above discussion, it cannot be said that impugned order is speaking and well-reasoned.\n\n13.     As  far  as  preliminary  objection  raised  by  the  learned  Law Officers that this petition is hit by Section 79 CPC and Article 174 of the Constitution is concerned, the perusal of the petition and its prayer shows that  the petitioner  has  not  challenged  any act  of  the  Government  of Punjab rather he has only assailed the order dated 04.04.2014 passed by respondent No.2.   Respondent No.2 is admittedly a statutory body, constituted under the “Punjab Emergency Services Act, 2006.” (Act). Under Section 4 of the Act, the Punjab Emergency Services shall be a body corporate which has the power to enter into contract and may sue or be sued in its own name. As no relief has been claimed against the Government of Punjab in this petition, therefore, Government of Punjab is  merely  a  proforma  respondent  and  even  if  the  petition  has  been wrongly filed against Government   of Punjab,   the same being maintainable  against  respondent  No.2,  which  is  a  statutory  body,  it cannot be dismissed on this ground alone. In this regard reliance is placed on  Salah ud Din and 2 others vs. Frontier Sugar Mills and Distiliary Ltd and 10 others  (PLD 1975 SC 244) and  Muhammad Younas Sheikh vs. Correx Enterprises and others (2007 MLD 508). The case law relied upon by the respondents in support of their arguments that this petition is hit by Section 79 CPC read with Article 174 of the Constitution is inapt to the facts and circumstances of the present case. It is expedient to briefly examine the case law referred by the respondents.  Province of the Punjab through Member Board of Revenue Lahore and others vs. Muhammad Hussain through Legal Heirs and others (PLD 1993 SC 147), the  Pakistan  was  sued  through  Chief  Settlement  Commissioner which was held to be illegal as Chief Settlement Commissioner did not exist after repeal of law, 1974 and MBR could not represent Pakistan, in Hfaiz Ikram Saeed vs. State (2013 SCMR 1045) the petition was filed by the Province of Punjab through Prosecutor General which petition was dismissed by the High Court and the august Supreme Court set aside the order of High Court and allowed the Government to file petition through Secretary Prosecution, in  Govt. of Balohistan vs. Nawabzada Mir Tariq Hussain Kha Magsi and others (2010 SCMR 115), the Province of Balochistan was sued through Collector/D.C. instead of Secretary; hence the suit was found not maintainable, in  Haji Abdul Aziz vs. Govt. of Balohistan through Deputy Commissioner  (1999 SCMR 16) the suit filed against   Government   of   Punjab   through   D.C.   whereas   in    Deputy Commissioner Sialkot and others vs. Hamid Khaldi and others (1987 CLC 2360) the suit was filed against the public functionaries without impleading Province of \n\ntouchstone that mechanism and manner under Rule 19 of PPRA, 2009 are not framed and it is also violative of fair trial and due process of law under Article 4, 9, 10-A and fundamental rights of the petitioner and its management under the Constitution; the petition is not hit by any has been ordered under PPRA, 2009 by respondent No.2. Therefore remedy of arbitration under clause 65 of the Contract is not available against such decision of blacklisting passed by respondent No.2. In any case the impugned order being without jurisdiction and the question involved in this petition requires interpretation of rules and enforcement of provisions of Articles 4, 9, 10- A and 18 of the Constitution, therefore, despite departmental remedy, if any, this constitutional petition is maintainable. Reliance is placed on Nawabzada Muhammad Amir Khan vs. The Controller of Estate Duty (2)Pakistan, through Secretary Ministry of Finance etc.  (PLD 1961 SC\n119),  The Burmah Oil Company(Pakistan Trading) Ltd,Chittagong   vs The Trustees of the Port of Chittagong  (PLD 1962 SC 113),  Nagina Silk Mill, Lyallpur vs. The I.T.O.

Through   this single judgment, I propose to decide the following constitutional petitions W.P.No.15025/10, W.P.No.22151/10, W.P.No.9588/10, W.P.No.4299/10, W.P.No.19012/10 and W.P.No.11188/10 as during the   pendency   of   these   petitions,   the   National   and   Provincial Assemblies have been dissolved and fresh general elections have been announced.\n\n2.       The respondents have raised the legal objection to the effect that after the dissolution of National and  Provincial Assemblies the cause of action has cease to exist.   Learned Counsel for the parties \n\n\n\n\nhave addressed  arguments on legal objection and to some extent on merits and it is decided that first the question of maintainability of the petition be resolved   and if this court comes to the conclusion that petitions are maintainable then parties will address the detailed arguments on merits.\n\n3.       Learned Counsel for the respondents have raised a preliminary objection about the maintainability of petition with reference to article\n199 (b)(ii) Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the Constitution) and submit that after the dissolution of National and Provincial  Assemblies the  respondents are no more holding the Public Office and ceased to be  the  holder of Public Office, hence the constitutional petitions become infructuous and are liable to be dismissed.\n\n4.       Briefly stated the facts of all the petitions are that the petitioners have challenged the genuineness of the respondents/ parliamentarians educational degrees in terms of mandatory requirements of Section 99 (cc) of the Representation of the People Act of 1976 read with Article\n62 and 63 of the Constitution. The petitioners allegation is that educational degree of graduation of respondents parliamentarian is fake document and as such the respondents be declared ineligible to hold the office of member parliament. The petitioners have prayed as\nunder;\n\n“It is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that by accepting the titled writ petition respondent No.1 may very kindly be directed to appear before this Hon’ble Court and to explain under what authority of law he has assumed the office of MNA and continue to hold the same thereafter his holding the office of MNA of NA-166 Arifwala may very kindly be declared as illegal and ordered to be set aside.\n\nAny other relief appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case may also very kindly be granted to the petitioners in the interest of justice and fair play.”\n\n5.       The respondents in the first instance have raised the objection about  the  maintainability  of  writ  of  quo  warranto  under  Article \n\n\n\n\n199(b) (ii) of the Constitution, the Hon’ble Chief Justice constituted a Full Bench for resolution of the respondents’ legal objection. The Full bench of this Court vide judgment dated 29.7.2011 held that writ of quo warranto is maintainable, the respondents assailed the judgment of Hon’ble Full Bench of this Court before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan vide Judgment dated 3.5.2012  remanded the case in the following terms;\n“1.        Let the High Court decide petitions pending before it on merits without being prejudice in any manner from the impugned judgment dated 29.7.2011.\n\n2.        All the petitions arising out of the impugned judgment shall be placed before a bench of a High Court for the purpose of consolidated judgment as the question of law and facts seems to be common in all these matters.\n\n3.        The petitioners shall free to approach this court after the judgment on merits pronounced if against them with further liberty to raise the question of maintainability of the petitions in the nature of qou warranto before this court in terms of the order impugned herein and in such eventuality no question of laches or limitation shall come in the way of the petitioners because the instant petitions raise a question of the constitutional nature.”\n\n6.       The  Hon’ble  Chief  Justice  assigned  all  the  constitutional petitions to this Bench. The petitions were pending disposal when on the advice of Prime Minster of Pakistan, the President of Pakistan dissolved the National Assembly on 16.3.2013 and announced the fresh general elections which are scheduled to be held on 11.5.2013.\n\n7.       The   respondents   parliamentarian   after   the   dissolution   of National and Provincial Assemblies filed application for dismissing the constitutional petitions having been infructuous, the petitioners opposed the petition and submits that inspite of the dissolution of the parliament,  the  petition  can  continue  as  is  held  by  the  Hon’ble Supreme   Court   of   Pakistan    Syed   Mehmood   Akhtar   Naqvi   v. \n\n\n\n\nFederation of Pakistan trough Secretary law and others  (PLD 2012\n\nSC 1089).\n\nLearned counsel further submits that no doubt respondents have ceased to hold their offices but there are other acts which the respondents have done during the usurpation of offices or prior to their termination as holders of public office.  It is yet to be decided that the respondents are liable to refund the huge amounts drawn in the shape of salaries and other benefits knowingly that they were holding the office on the basis of a fake degree.\n\n8.       Learned   Counsels   for   respondents   submit   that   after   the dissolution of national and provincial assemblies the respondents have ceased to be the holder of public office and petitions become infructuous. Learned Counsels vehemently argues that the relief of quo warranto could not be granted where it is useless and effective measures can not be taken for undoing the acts done by the person concerned. They further argued that disqualification to hold a public office must exist both at the time of the filing of the constitutional petition and at the time of its decision and submit that on the day of filing the constitution petition   the requirement of graduation degree was not the statutory requirement for the legislators and as such the petition is liable to be dismissed in addition to the preliminary objection about the maintainability of the petition.   The writ of quo warranto can only be issued where the person under attack must have the real possession of the public office. The court can issue writ only when the public office is held by a particular person in an illegal manner.\nLearned Counsels have relied on  Khuda Bakash v. Mir Zafar Ullah Jamali (1997 SCMR 561),  Ch. Muneer Ahmed and Others v. Malik Nawab Sher and Others (PLD 2010 Lahore 625),   Haji Khizar Hayat v. Sarfraz Khan & another  (PLD 1968 Lahore 381),  P. L.

Heard, record perused.\n\n10.     It is an admitted fact between the parties that National and\n\nProvincial assemblies have been dissolved and the General Elections \n\n\n\n\nhave been scheduled to be held on 11.5.2013 and at present the respondents are not holding any public office.\n\n11.     The argument of learned counsel for petitioners is that it is a proven  fact  on  record  that  graduation  degree  claimed  by  the respondent is fake as is confirmed by the concerned University and the Board of Intermediate.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has already held in  Mian Najeeb ud Din Owasi & another v Amir Yar Waran, etc. (CMA No.1712/12 in CA Nos.191-L & 409/10) as under;\n“Notwithstanding whether  the  condition of  being  a  graduate or having a degree equal to the requisite academic skill was not available  subsequent  to  the  General  Election  2008,  and  the judgment in the case of Muhammad Nasir Mahmood and others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary M/O Law (PLD 2009 SC\n107) yet if a candidate has made a declaration in the column meant for academic qualification and declared himself to be a graduate, but subsequently, it is found that he was not a graduate then he would equally be liable to face the consequences under Articles 62\n& 63 of the Constitution.”\n\n\nThe learned counsel submits that the General Election 2013 has been  announced  and  in  case  the  respondents’  degrees  were  not declared fake, the holders of fake degrees will again contest the election and will usurp the most important office meant for legislation for the country.\n\n12.     The crucial point requires for determination is whether after dissolution  of National and  Provincial Assemblies, a writ of quo- warranto can be issued or not.\n\n13.   For appreciating the argument of learned counsels for the respondents, Article 199(b)(ii) is reproduce as under;\n“(b)    on the application of any person, make an order--- (i)       ………………………….\n(ii)      Requiring a person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court holding or purporting to hold a public office to show under what authority of law he claims to hold that office; or”\n\n\n14.     It is settled principle of law that a writ of quo-Warranto is information in nature placed before the Court and the petitioner may \n\n\n\n\nnot  be  an  aggrieved  person.    Halsbury’s  Laws  of  England, Third\nEdition, Volume 11, Para 281 defines the writ of quo Warranto as under:\n\n“An information in the nature of a quo Warranto was not issued, and an injunction in lieu thereof will not be granted, as a matter of course.  It is in the discretion of the Court to refuse or grant it according to the facts and circumstances  of the case ……………………….. the Court might in its discretion decline to grant a quo Warranto information where it would be vexatious to do so, or where an information would be futile in its results, or where there was an alternative remedy which was equally appropriate and effective.”\n\n15.     The words in Article 199(b)(ii) of the Constitution are “holding\n\nor purporting to hold a public office”.\n\n\n16.     It is an admitted fact that after dissolution of the Parliament, the respondents are ceased to be its members and the holders of the public office.  In Indian jurisdiction, a similar question arose whether writ of quo warranto can be issued where holder of public office ceased to hold the office;  P.L.Lakhanpal v. Ajit Nath Ray, Chief Justice of India, New Delhi and others  (AIR 1975 Delhi 66 Full Bench).  In this case, Government of India by ignoring three senior Judges of the Supreme Court of India appointed a Chief Justice who was fourth in seniority, all the three senior Judges resigned and the matter was brought before the Court.   The Full Bench of the Delhi High Court held that the issuance of quo Warranto will be a futile exercise as the three senior Judges have already resigned. The Full Bench opined as under:\n“13.     I now deal with the points urged by the Attorney-General. Relying upon  the  petitioner’s  own  case  that  the  convention  of  appointing  the senior-most puisne Judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice of India since the establishment of the Supreme Court is a rule of law and inheres in Article 124(2) of the Constitution, he contends that the issue of a writ of quo Warranto by this Court will be futile because as a result of the resignations of Justices Shelat, Hegde and Grover, who were senior to him, Justice A. N. Ray became the senior-most puisne Judge and not only could be re-appointed but would be entitled to be re-appointed as Chief Justice of India. This contention would not have been available to the respondents if the three Judges who were senior to Justice A. N. Ray had not vacated their office by resignation but now it is. The contention is countered by Mr. Lakhanpal, who appeared in person, by arguing that if the appointment of Justice A. N. Ray as Chief Justice of India is set at naught by a writ of quo Warranto, then he will automatically ceased to be a Judge of the Supreme Court because on his appointment as Chief Justice of India, the warrant of his appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court automatically ceased to exist or to have any validity or effect. ” \n\n\n\n\n17.     A  similar  question  again  was  considered  by  Bombay  High\n\nCourt in  Pundlik Vishwapath v. Mahader Binjraj and others (AIR\n\n1959 Bombay 2 (V 46 C 2), the Bombay High Court held as under:\n\n“(14)   The petitioner has also prayed in his petition a relief for a writ of quo Warranto against the respondent No.1 and a direction restraining him from acting as a Councilor of the Nagpur Corporation and/or represent the defunct Chamber. This question cannot be considered in this petition, particularly as respondent No.1 has not assumed office, as we are informed.   This prayer is rejected in limine. The petitioner will be at liberty to apply, if he is so advised, in case and when the respondent No.1 assumes office.”\n\n18.     The Bombay High Court in  The State of Bombay v. Smt.Shirish V. Pai and others  (AIR 1959 Bombay 6 (V 46 C 3) in the similar circumstances held as under:\n“(18)   At first blush there appears to be a good deal of force in the contention advanced on behalf of the respondents, but on closer scrutiny the contention advanced on behalf of the petitioners will be found to be more forceful so far as the prayer for the issue of a writ of quo Warranto is concerned. The aforesaid writ is a common law process of great antiquity, a writ of right for the King against one who claimed or usurped an office, franchise or liberty to enquire by what authority he asserted a right thereto in order that it might be determined. As information in the nature of quo Warranto is tis modern form. It has been held in the case of Pundit Vishwapath v. Mahadeo Binjraj, AIR 1959 Bom 2 that a petition for a writ of quo Warranto against a councilor elected to a municipal corporation does not lie where the councilor has not assumed office. Thus unless a person occupies an office an inquiry into the validity of the authority for the occupation of that office cannot be made and the present petition so far as it relates to the issue of a writ in the nature of quo Warranto cannot be said to have been filed after inordinate delay. The aforesaid aspect of the matter does not appear to have been raised or considered in the earlier writ petitions dismissed by this Court on the ground of delay. So far as the prayer for the issue of a writ of mandamus is concerned, there can be no doubt that the prayer is a belated one and must be refused. ”\n\n19.     When  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,\n\n1962 was abrogated, the appeals relating to election disputes were pending before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan against the writ petitions decided by the High Courts.   The legality and maintainability of the pendency of the  appeals were examined by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in  Abdul Hamid v. Muhammad Shahidullah  and  3  others   (PLD  1969  SC  535)  and  the  Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:\n“It is common knowledge, that according to the old practice the petition abated or dropped in such a case. Keating, J. was of the same opinion, for, he too held that “the effect of the dissolution, as it seems to me, is to cause the petition to drop”. It is clear, therefore, that the moment the \n\n\n\n\ndissolution takes place the petition is at an end for all purposes. These principles are, in our view, applicable with equal force in the present case. The National Assembly having itself been dissolved by the Proclamation of the 25th  March 1969, the position, in our opinion, is the same  and  all  pending  petitions  must  be  dropped  as  having  become\ninfructuous. In these circumstances we dismiss both these appeals on the ground that they have become infructuous but make no order as to costs.”\n\n20.     In   Pakistan  through  the  Secretary,  National  Assembly  v. Khondkar Ali Afzal and another  (PLD 1990 SC 1) in a similar issue the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan held as under:\n“Secondly, the relief prayed for in the petition had ceased to be available to the respondent because the post of the Joint Secretary to the National Assembly had been abolished before the announcement of the judgment. On the day the judgment was rendered the High Court could not have issued a writ of mandamus requiring the Government to reinstate the respondent to a post which had been validly abolished. Though this aspect of the matter must have been present to the minds of the learned Judges, there is not one word about it in the judgment and the matter has been decided and a writ issued against the Government in respect of a matter to which the attention of the parties was never directed. It is of the very essence of judicial proceedings that the relief to be granted should follow as a legal result from the right alleged and found. The error in the proceedings is therefore fundamental where the relief granted is different form the one prayed and flows not from the right alleged but from a right which has not been pleaded and as to which the Court has never heard the parties. This is true in all proceedings but more so in proceedings for prerogative writ where the Court does not generally act ex debito justitiae but confines the petitioner to a specific right and a specific relief.   We allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court and dismiss the respondent’s petition for a writ. In the circumstances, we have mentioned, parties will bear their own costs.”\n\n21.     From the above said judicial pronouncement it is clear that writ of quo warranto can be issued against a person who is holding a public office without any lawful authority or he is a usurper.   The word used in Article 199 (b)(ii) of the Constitution are “the holder of public  office” denotes that relief of writ of quo  warranto will be available to a person against a holder of public office and not a retired person.   The intention of the legislator is clear  that relief of quo Warranto is available only against those who are present not who were Public Office holder or would be Public Office holder.  When the holder of public office ceased to hold the office, the relief of quo Warranto also becomes not available to an aggrieved party or any other person.\n\n22.     The only object of the writ of quo warranto is to inquire into and determine the authority of a person holding a public office, and \n\n\n\n\nthe consequence of the acceptance of the petition is the ouster of the person  from  the  public  office,  the  relief  by  way  of  writ  of  quo warranto remain only available so long as the person attacked is in actual possession and user of the office.\n\n23.     As a general rule, therefore, quo warranto to question a person’s title to office will not be granted after he has ceased to hold that office.\n\n24.     The second argument of learned counsel for petitioner is that although the respondents have ceased to hold their offices, but the other matters as to the recovery of salaries and other benefits which the respondents have taken or enjoyed knowingly that they have been elected by defrauding their voters are yet to be adjudicated upon and this court can grant relief under the established principle of law that court  has  the powers  to  grant  modified  relief.    This  argument  of learned counsel is not sustainable as it is an established principle of law that no such relief can be available in a proceeding for quo warranto. The writ of quo warranto cannot be used to quash acts already done  by a  usurper.    Quo  warranto  is  meant  to  prevent  a continued  exercise of authority unlawfully asserted, not  to  correct what already has been done under it or to vindicate private rights.\n\n25.     As far as the right of a person to ask for refund of salaries or other benefits from a usurper to a public office is concerned, It could not  to  be determined  in  a proceeding  for quo  warranto. The said determination is an independent right and can be ascertained in appropriate proceedings according to law.\n\n26.     The argument of learned counsel for the petitioners that the respondents are proven to be the holders of fake educational degrees, they violated the law, they defrauded their voters and caused loss to the government exchequer, they all are unable to legislate law which is their basic duty being legislature is concerned, the petitioners have the right to initiate appropriate proceedings against the respondents according to law. As I have come to the conclusion that petitions are \n\n\n\n\nnot maintainable due to legal infirmity, both the parties are at liberty to get their grievance redressed according to law in an appropriate legal proceedings.\n\n27.     As   the   fresh   general   election   has   been   announced,   the petitioners have a remedy, they may raise objection before the Returning Officer against the respondents if the respondents intends to contest the election and the respondents have filed the nomination papers for contesting the election.  The Returning Officer according to law is duty bound to decide the eligibility of the candidate qua Article\n62 and 63 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,\n\n1973.\n\n28.     The upshot of the above said discussion is that the petitions are disposed of having become infructuous.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n*KMSubhani*\n \n(Muhammad Khalid Mehmood Khan) Judge \n\n\n\nAnnounced in open Court on 04.04.2013.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n*KMSubhani*\n \n(Muhammad Khalid Mehmood Khan) Judge \n\nApproved for reporting.\n"\n', '1992 S.C. 646,PLD 1987 L 786,PLD 1987 L 786,1998 PLC (CS) 1218,1998 PLC (CS) 1218,PLD 2012 SC 132,PLD 2012 SC 132,2010 (6) Supreme Court Cases 331,PLD 1993 SC 341,1997 SCMR 641,', 'PLD-2013-Lahore-586.pdf');

Through this composite judgment I intend to decide this Civil Revision No.367-2004 titled ‘Khushi Muhammad Vs. Muhammad Ashfaq’ as well as Civil Revision No.368-2004 titled ‘Khushi Muhammad Vs. Muhammad Ashfaq’ arising out of the same consolidated judgment and decree dated 20.9.1992 passed by learned Civil Judge Arifwala and the consolidated judgment and decree dated 04.7.1997 passed by learned Additional District Judge Arifwala.\n\n2. Succinctly the facts leading to these civil revisions are that Mumtaz Ali (deceased predecessor of the respondents) filed a suit for declaration etc on 04.5.1983 against Hasab ud Din (deceased predecessor of the petitioners) alleging that he was owner in possession of the suit shop by conditional sale through registered mortgage deed executed by Hasab ud Din in his favour. The suit was resisted by Hasab ud Din by filing contesting written statement with the contentions that he being an illiterate old aged villager mortgaged\nhis shop in dispute in favour of Mumtaz Ali for a sum of Rs.7500/-vide mortgage deed dated 21.5.1969 but the said Mumtaz Ali fraudulently manipulated the entries regarding conditional sale mortgage price as Rs.10000/- instead of Rs.7500/- and period of six months for redemption of mortgage. Hasab ud Din also filed a separate suit for redemption on 30.7.1983 which was contested by Mumtaz Ali. Both the suits were consolidated on 23.5.1985 and following consolidated issues were framed by the learned trial Court:-\n\n1. Whether the suit has been incorrectly valued for the purposes of value and jurisdiction? If so, what is correct value and to what affect?OPD \n\n2. Whether the suit is within time?OPP \n\n3. Whether the suit is liable to be dismissed for misdescription of suit property?OPD \n\n4. Whether the plaintiff is owner in possession of the suit property?OPP \n\n5.

Whether the suit of the defendant is not maintainable in view of the preliminary objection No.1.?OPP \n\n7. Whether the suit of the defendant has been incorrectly valued for the purposes of court fee and jurisdiction? If so, what is its correct value and to what affect?OPP \n\n8. Whether the defendant is entitled to the possession of the suit property through redemption?OPP \n\n9. Relief. \n\n3. Parties led their pro and contra evidence in support of their respective pleas. The learned trial Court vide consolidated judgment and decree dated 20.3.1986 decreed the suit for declaration etc. filed by Mumtaz Ali and dismissed the suit for redemption filed by Hasab ud Din. Being aggrieved Hasab ud Din preferred two separate appeals before the learned Additional District Judge Sahiwal\nwhich were allowed vide consolidated judgment and decree date 18.6.1989 and both the cases were remanded for fresh decision with\n\nfollowing additional issues:-\n\n8-A. Whether Mumtaz Ali plaintiff perfected title over the property in dispute by adverse possession? OPP\n\n8-B. Whether the deed registered on 21.5.1969 is a mortgage by conditional sale or sale with condition of re-purchase? OP-Parties.\n\n8-C. Whether the deed registered on 21.5.1969 was obtained by the plaintiff from the defendant through fraud and exploitation of his illiteracy and simpletonness? OPD\n\n8-D. Whether the condition contained in the deed registered on 21.5.1969 that in defaulter of payment of Rs.10,000/-within six months the transaction shall stand converted into a sale deed, is void, illegal and of no effect against the rights of the defendant? OPD.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n4. In  post  remand  proceedings  parties  did  not  lead  any\n\nevidence. Learned trial Court after providing opportunity of hearing to\n\nthe learned counsel for the parties decreed the suit for declaration filed\n\nby Mumtaz Ali and dismissed the suit for redemption filed by Hasab\n\nud  Din  vide  impugned  consolidated  judgment  and  decree  dated\n\n20.9.1992.  Hasab  ud  Din  assailed  the  same  through  two  separate\n\nappeals before the learned Additional District Judge Arifwala which\n\nwere also dismissed vide impugned consolidated judgment and decree\n\ndated 04.7.1997, hence these civil revisions.\n\n\n5. It is argued by learned counsel for the petitioner that\n\nfindings of the learned trial Court on issue Nos.2, 8-A,B,C & D as\n\nmaintained by learned Appellate Court are erroneous, against law and\n\nfacts, based on misreading and non-reading of the material available\n\non the record and liable to set aside; that learned Courts below while\n\nrecording  concurrent  findings  were  in  grave  error  to  hold  that\n\nimpugned transaction was a mortgage by conditional sale or that on\n\naccount of  non-payment  of  the  mortgage  money within stipulated\n\nperiod i.e. six months the same has attained the status of sale or that\n \n\nthe impugned condition of sale was not a clog on the mortgage. It is further argued that learned trial Court also fell in legal error while holding the petitioner’s suit for redemption as barred by limitation in terms of Section 120 of the Limitation Act 1908. Learned counsel for the petitioner added that impugned concurrent findings suffer from misinterpretation of document, against law and facts, based on misreading and non-reading of evidence, untenable and liable to set aside.\n\n6. Both the civil revisions are resisted by learned counsel for the respondent with the contentions that Hasab ud Din has admitted the execution of mortgage deed but failed to prove his contention with regard to any fraudulent manipulation of condition of sale, amount of mortgage and stipulated period for redemption through any reliable ocular or documentary evidence; that on account of mortgagor’s failure to return the mortgage amount within stipulated period of six months the transaction stood matured as sale in favour of Mumtaz Ali: that petitioners have no case to seek possession of the dispute shop through redemption of the mortgage after lapse of about fourteen years; that concurrent findings of the learned Courts below based on salutary appreciation of evidence do not suffer from any factual or legal infirmity therefore petitioners have no case to invoke the revisional jurisdiction of this Court and that both the revision petitions are liable to be dismissed.\n\n7. Arguments heard. Record perused.\n\n\n8. The controversy in hand mainly relates to interpretation of the document i.e. mortgage deed No.67 dated 21.5.1969 (Exh.P1). Mumtaz Ali alleged that it was a mortgage by conditional sale which has attained the status of absolute sale for non-payment of mortgage money within stipulated period of six months. On the other hand Hasab ud Din predecessor of the petitioners contended that it was a usufructuary mortgage and that entries regarding conditional sale, mortgage price and stipulated period of six months for redemption of mortgage were fraudulently manipulated by Mumtaz Ali.\n \n\n9. In legal history, mortgages underwent a process of evolution. A mortgage by conditional sale was a very early form of mortgage among Hindus. Among Mohammedans the mortgage by conditional sale was a device to evade the Islamic Prohibition of interest. This was ordinarily called as bye-bil-wafa i.e. a sale with promise so that the mortgagee enjoys the rent and profit in lieu of interest and became absolute owner of the property if the debt was not paid. The earliest form of Mohammedan security was the rahn or pledge or mortgage with possession corresponding to the Roman\n\nPignus which was a transfer not of ownership but of possession without liability to forfeiture. In this case mortgage deed (Exh.P1) speaks for itself that the same was created under most pressing demand for money as the mortgagor parted with the possession and income of the shop. In such cases a moment of weakness of needy person is exploited by the mortgagee. He enjoys the usufruct of the mortgaged property in his possession with increased market value attracting all the ingredients of interest forbidden in Islam. In such circumstances Courts of law and equity are expected to construe various transactions concerning mortgage in such a liberal way that the right of rightful owner survives and the one who has enjoyed the possession of usufructuary of the mortgaged property for a considerable time and thus has recovered the amount manifold, should not be allowed to get away with the mortgaged property as well. Reliance be made upon Maqbool Ahmed Vs. Government of\n\nPakistan (1991 SCMR 2063).\n\n\n10. In clause (a) of Section 58 of the Transfer of the Property Act 1882, a mortgage is the transfer of an interest in specific immovable property for the purpose of securing the payment of money advanced or to be advanced by way of loan, an existing or future debt, or the performance of an engagement which may give rise to a pecuniary liability. Remaining clauses of this Section however define different kinds of mortgages. For the purpose of this case clause (c) and clause (d) of Section 58 of the Transfer of Property Act 1882 are relevant which read as under:-\n \n\n“(c) Mortgage by conditional sale: Where the mortgagor ostensibly sells the mortgaged property—\n\nOn condition that on default of the payment of the mortgage-money on a certain date the sale shall become absolute, or\n\nOn condition that on such payment being made the sale shall become void, or\n\nOn condition that, on such payment being made the buyer shall transfer the property to the seller,\n\nThe transaction is called a mortgage by conditional sale and the mortgagee a mortgagee by conditional sale:\n\nProvided that no such transaction shall be deemed to be a mortgage, unless the condition is embodied in the document which effects or purports to effect the sale.\n\n(d) Usufructuary mortgage: Where the mortgagor delivers possession or expressly or by implication binds himself to deliver possession of the mortgaged property to the mortgagee and authorizes him to retain such possession until payment of the mortgage-money, and to receive the rents and profits accruing from the property or any part of such rents and profits and to appropriate the same in lieu of interest, or in payment of the mortgage-money, or partly in lieu of interest or partly in payment of the mortgage-money, the transaction is called an usufructuary mortgage and the mortgagee an usufructuary mortgagee.”\n\n\n\n\n11. While referring to the proviso of clause (c) (supra) it is emphatically argued by learned counsel for the respondents that mortgage deed (Exh.P1) failing to contain an unambiguous condition which effects or purports to effect the sale in favour of the respondents clearly manifests that impugned transaction between the parties was not mortgage and that transaction between the parties has attained status of absolute sale for non-payment of mortgage money on expiry of stipulated period of six months. I am afraid learned counsel for the respondents is misconceived. Transfer of Property Act 1882 being not enforced in the Province of the Punjab therefore its provisions are not binding on the Courts in this Province. However there is no cavil to the proposition that in the areas of which the Act\n \n\nhas not been extended its general principles in accordance with rules of justice, equity and good conscience are followed. Needless to say that technical provisions of the Act are not obligatory.\n\n12. The ‘absolute sale’ and ‘mortgage with conditional sale’ are two different types of transactions. In the first category relationship of borrower and creditor do not exist between the parties and the title in the property is absolutely passed on to the vendee by virtue of the sale deed. The second category however manifests the arrangement for borrowing money much below the value of the property which is tendered as security for payment of the loan and if it is not paid the creditor can fall back on the security. In this instance having been created relationship of the mortgagor and mortgagee the ostensible owner of the property retains the interest in it.\n\n13. It is settled principle of law that interpretation of a document is strictly a question of law and not a fact however for finding out the real character of the transaction the intention of the parties to the document furnishes a positive test. Such intention, however, must essentially be gathered from the language adopted in the document viewed in the light of the surrounding circumstances. Reliance be made upon Muhammad Kazam through Legal Heirs\n\nVs. Mst.Janat Bibi (PLD 1985 Lahore 637).\n\n\n14. Bare reading of mortgage deed (Exh.P1) transpires that it bears title RAHN-BA-QABZA DUKAN (mortgage with possession of shop). Mumtaz Ali (respondent) being beneficiary of the document (Exh.P1) was under obligation to establish that the impugned transaction was a mortgage by conditional sale and not a usufructuary mortgage. He has produced Kh.Mudadat Hussain petition writer (PW-1) the scribe of the mortgage deed (Exh.P1). While facing the cross-examination the said PW-1 admitted that contents of mortgage deed (Exh.P1) were not read over to the mortgagor. Akhtar Ali (PW-3) an attesting witness of mortgage deed (Exh.P1) while facing the cross-examination stated that at the time of deal of mortgage between the parites at Arifwala no conversation between the parties had taken place as regards bye-bil-wafa. Mian Ahmed Yar Khan (PW-2) the\n \n\nother marginal witness of mortgage deed (Exh.P1) while facing the cross-examination stated that the expression bye-bil-wafa in the mortgage deed (Exh.P1) was scribed by the petition writer himself. Statements of both the attesting witnesses that contents of mortgage deed (Exh.P1) were read over to Hasab ud Din mortgagor are not supported by the scribe (PW-1) therefore Mumtaz Ali mortgagee respondent has not been able to produce any reliable and confidence inspiring ocular or documentary account to establish that impugned transaction was mortgage by conditional sale or bye-bil-wafa.\n\n15. On the other hand, petitioners’ witnesses in their testimonies have categorically stated that market value of the shop at the time of mortgage was about Rs.50/60 thousand i.e. much more then mortgage money i.e. Rs.10,000/-. They were not particularly cross-examined by the respondents on this dimension. Respondents’ witnesses in their testimonies did not state that the market value of the shop was Rs.10,000/- at the time of mortgage. Besides it is pertinent to note that contents of mortgage deed (Exh.P1) clearly manifest that income of the mortgaged property and interest on the loan will be treated equal. It is therefore obvious that transfer of the shop as security for a loan of Rs.10,000/- i.e. a considerable low price apparently was a usufructuary mortgage rather mortgage by conditional sale. The respondent/mortgagee has not been able to establish it as mortgage by conditional sale or bye-bil-wafa through any reliable and confidence inspiring ocular or documentary account. The petitioner has been described as mortgagor and the respondent as mortgagee in the mortgage deed (Exh.P1) and its language unequivocally demonstrate that transaction in dispute was in fact a usufructuory mortgage and not an absolute sale.\n\n16. At this juncture it may be expedient to reproduce the provisions of Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act 1882 which reads below:-\n\n\n\n“60.   Right of mortgagor to redeem: At any time after\n \n\nthe principal money has become due, the mortgagor has a\n \n\nright, on payment or tender, at the proper time and place, of the mortgage-money, to require the mortgagee (a) to deliver to the mortgagor the mortgaged-deed and all documents relating to the mortgaged property which are in the possession or power of the mortgagee, (b) where the mortgagee is in possession of the mortgaged property, to deliver possession thereof to the mortgagor, and (c) at the cost of the mortgagor either to re-transfer the mortgaged property to him or to such third person as he may direct, or to execute and (where the mortgage has been effected by a registered instrument) to have registered an acknowledgment in writing that any right is derogation of his interest transferred to the mortgagee has been extinguished:\n\nProvided that the right conferred by this section has not been extinguished by the act of the parties or by decree of a Court.\n\nThe right conferred by this section is called a right to redeem and a suit to enforce it is called a suit for redemption.\n\nNothing in this section shall be deemed to render invalid any provision to the effect that, if the time fixed for payment of the principal money has been allowed to pass or no such time has been fixed, the mortgagee shall be entitled to reasonable notice before payment or tender of such money.\n\nRedemption of portion of mortgaged property. Nothing in this section shall entitle a person interested in a share only of the mortgaged property to redeem his own share only, on payment of a proportionate part of the amount remaining due on the mortgage, except only where a mortgagee, or, if there are more mortgagees than one, all such mortgagees, has or have acquired, in whole or in part, the share of a mortgagor.”\n\n\n17. The expression ‘provided that the right conferred by this section has not been extinguished by the act of the parties or decree of the Court’ used in the above quoted provision is of grave importance. In the present case none of these circumstances exists. There is no decree of the Court nor did parties take any action after the initial execution of mortgage deed (Exh.P1) on 21.5.1969 to extinguish the right of redemption which had come into existence by the very nature of the transaction. In terms of Section 60 of the Transfer of Property\n \n\nAct 1882 the right of redemption is statutory right. Besides it is also a rule of justice, equity and good conscience. It has been variously held by the Superior Courts that any clog on redemption of the mortgage will be invalid being violative to the law and equity. Section 60 of the Act ibid unequivocally affirms the right of redemption in all mortgages following the principle ‘once a mortgage always a mortgage’. Reliance be made upon Suleman and 3 others Vs.\n\nCustodian,  Evacuee  Property,  West  Pakistan,  Lahore  and  2\n\nothers (PLD 1971 Lahore 77). The contention of learned counsel for the respondent that the transaction of mortgage in dispute should be treated as sale and the respondent be treated as owner in possession of the disputed shop for non-payment of mortgage money on the expiry of stipulated period of six months therefore is devoid of any force for the simple reason that the impugned stipulation is a clog on the petitioners’ right of redemption and as such repugnant to law and void. In this regard reliance is placed upon an observation made by Lord Hanley in a case titled Vernon V. Bethell (2Eden.113) which reads below:-\n\n“The Court, as a Court of Conscience is very jealous of persons taking securities for a loan and converting such securities into purchases. And, therefore, I can take it to be an established rule, that a mortgagee can never provide at the time of making the land for any event or condition on which the equity of redemption shall be discharged and the conveyance absolute. And there is great reason and justice in this rule for necessitous men or not, truly speaking, free men, but to answer a present exigency, will submit to any terms that crafty may impose upon them.”\n\n\n\n18. The proviso of Section 60 of the Act clearly contemplates that subsequent to the mortgage transaction the parties may by their act extinguish the right of redemption but not in the same transaction by which the mortgage is created. There is no cavil to the proposition that consequent to the original transaction the parties are not debarred from converting the transaction from mortgage into a sale by drawing up a separate sale deed otherwise the transaction would remain a\n \n\nmortgage and possession of mortgagee would not be converted into possession as an owner therefore condition imposed in mortgage deed (Exh.P1) being a clog on the equity of redemption is void and inoperative and possession of the respondent over the shop will remain as mortgagee and would not be converted into a possession as vendee. Reliance be made upon Abdur Rahim Vs. Abdul Malak and others (PLD 1971 Azad J & K 1) and Mir Zaman Vs. Ashraf\n\nKhan (PLD 1959 Azad J. & K. 73).\n\n\n19. As regards the point of limitation and laches suffice to say that once it is held that the disputed transaction is one of the mortgage and not the absolute sale the refusal to get the property redeemed therefore becomes recurring wrong on the part of the mortgagee for which the principle of laches is not attracted at all. Reliance be made upon Mr.Fazlul Quader Chowdhry and others\n\nVs.  Mr.Muhammad  Abdul  Haque  (PLD 1963 Supreme  Court\n\n486). Besides it is pertinent to mention that when a matter is referable to the law of limitation the question of laches looses significance. Contents of mortgage deed (Exh.P1) contain that income of the mortgaged property and interest on the loan advanced to the mortgagee will be treated equal. It is obvious that respondent/mortgagee being in possession of the mortgaged shop is continuously enjoying the income of the mortgaged property as payment of interest on the debt which would amount to acknowledgment on the part of mortgagee giving fresh time of limitation within the meanings of Section 20 of the Limitation Act 1908. In the attending circumstances of this case no period of limitation would run against the petitioner/mortgagor. The property can be get redeemed by the petitioner/mortgagor at any stage without mischief of the law of limitation barring redemption after the passage of sixty years in terms of Article 158 of the Limitation Act 1908. Reliance be made upon Abdul Haq Vs. Ali Akbar and 12 others\n\n(1998 CLC 129 Peshawar).\n\n20. The nutshell of the above discussion is that concurrent findings of the learned Courts below non-suiting the petitioner and\n \n\ndecreeing the respondent’s suit for declaration etc. based on wrong premises of law and facts, misreading and non-reading of evidence, misinterpretation of the document being untenable are liable to set aside.\n\n21. For the above reasons both these civil revisions are allowed, impugned judgments and decrees passed by learned Courts below are set aside and the suit for declaration etc. lodged by Mumtaz Ali mortgagee is dismissed and the suit for redemption of the mortgage etc. lodged by Hasab ud Din mortgagor succeeds in terms that petitioners are entitled to the redemption of the mortgage in lieu of Rs.10,000/-. A preliminary decree in terms of Order 34 Rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 is therefore passed in favour of the petitioners against the respondents directing the petitioners to pay the mortgage money Rs.10,000/- within a period of 90 days into the learned trial Court and ordering the respondents to return all the documents in their possession or power relating to the mortgage property and to retransfer the mortgaged property to the petitioners at their costs free from the mortgage and from all encumbrance if any created by them and put the petitioners in possession of the property. Learned trial Court is directed to proceed further in the matter in accordance with law.\n\nOrder accordingly. \n\n\n\n\n\n"\n', '1991 SCMR 2063,PLD 1985 Lahore 637,PLD 1971 Azad J & K 1,PLD 1959 Azad J. & K. 73,PLD 1963 Supreme Court 486,1998 CLC 129 Peshawar', 'PLD-2014-Lahore-26.pdf'),

The respondent/defendant served  a  notice  dated 16.11.1999 upon the appellant whereby he intimated the appellant/plaintiff that he has cancelled the agreements to sell and forfeited the earnest money. Upon this, admittedly, the present appellant instituted a civil suit for specific performance of the agreements to sell in the court of learned Civil Judge, Islamabad on 20.4.2000. The objection was raised before the learned Civil Judge, Islamabad by the respondent/defendant that the subject property had then become part of the District Rawalpindi, therefore, the suit instituted by the respondent in Islamabad was not competent. The learned Civil   Judge,   Islamabad   vide   order   dated 30.01.2002 returned the plaint to the appellant for presentation before the proper court. The appellant then moved an application for review of the said order, which review application remained pending and was ultimately dismissed on 26.5.2003.  The appellant thereafter instituted a suit on 18.6.2003 before the learned Senior Civil Judge, Rawalpindi for specific performance of the contracts in question. The present respondent appeared as a defendant in the suit and submitted his written statement. The institution of the suit at Islamabad earlier by the plaintiff/appellant was admitted by the respondent in his written statement. The respondent moved an application under Order VII rule 11 CPC for the rejection of the plaint of the appellant on the ground that the suit instituted at Rawalpindi is barred by time. The learned Civil Judge, Rawalpindi through the impugned order and decree rejected the plaint of the suit of the appellant on the ground that it is barred by time keeping in view the principles of Section   113   of   the   Limitation   Act   1908, therefore, through the instant R.F.A. the impugned  order  and  decree  passed  by  the learned Civil Judge has been assailed.\n3.            It  has  been  argued  by  the  learned counsel for the appellant that in Para-1-A of the plaint  instituted  by  the  appellant  before  the learned Senior Civil Judge, Rawalpindi it was specifically  mentioned  that  the  suit  was  first filed  within  period  of  limitation  before  the learned Senior Civil Judge, Islamabad and there an objection was raised by the present respondent/defendant that the subject property had become part of the District Rawalpindi, therefore, the plaint be returned for presentation before the proper court. The learned counsel for the  appellant  has  further  contended  that  not only these facts were specifically stated by the appellant in his plaint but were also admitted by the  respondent  and  the  appellant  had  also moved an application under Section 14 of the Limitation Act 1908 for condonation of delay, if any, in presenting the plaint on the ground that he first instituted the suit in the court of learned Senior Civil Judge, Islamabad and then before the learned Civil Judge, Rawalpindi. Learned counsel for the appellant further contends that the plaint as a whole is to be read by the courts for  the  purpose  of  applying  the  principles  of Order VII rule 11 CPC and the learned Civil Judge,  Rawalpindi  without  adverting  to  this principle of law rejected the plaint of the suit illegally.\n\n4.            Learned  counsel  for  the  respondent has vehemently contested the instant R.F.A. by arguing  that  in  the  agreements  to  sell  in question, a specific date for completion of the transaction was mentioned. Learned counsel for the respondent has further contended that in the first agreement dated 26.12.1996 a specific date i.e 31.1.1997 was fixed for completion of the agreement and thereafter, through second agreement this period for completion of the agreement    to    sell    was    extended    up-till 15.10.1999. Learned counsel for the respondent contends that keeping in view the contents of Para-14 of the plaint the suit instituted by the appellant in Rawalpindi was barred by time as according to the learned counsel for the respondent the plaint was returned by the learned Civil Judge, Islamabad vide order dated 30.1.2002 and then the appellant filed an application for review of the said order which application   for   review   was   dismissed   on 26.5.2003. Learned counsel for the respondent has further contended that the institution of the suit at Rawalpindi on 18.6.2003 was clearly barred by time from the date mentioned in the agreements to sell. Learned counsel relies upon\nthe judgment reported as  Haji Abdul Karim and others  versus  Messrs  Florida  Builders  (Pvt) Limited (PLD 2012 Supreme Court 247).\n\n\n5.            We have heard the arguments of the learned  counsels  for  the  parties  and  have perused the record with their able assistance.\n\n6.            The   learned   Civil   Judge   in   the impugned order of rejection of plaint has completely overlooked the facts mentioned in Para-1-A of the plaint that the present appellant first instituted the suit for specific performance of agreements to sell  in the Court of learned Senior Civil Judge, Islamabad on 20.4.2000 within the period of limitation prescribed for the suits for specific performance of contracts and after about two years i.e. 30.01.2002 the learned Civil Judge, Islamabad was persuaded by the objections raised by the present respondent/defendant in the said suit that the suit be instituted at a proper place as it was no competent before the civil courts at Islamabad. It has also been observed that a review application was moved by the appellant which review application also remained pending before the learned Civil Judge, Islamabad and was ultimately  dismissed  on  26.5.2003.  The appellant filed an application under section 14 of the Limitation Act 1908 for condonation of delay.  The  learned  Civil  Judge  did  not  even attend to this application of the appellant filed alongwith the plaint. The order for rejection of plaint was passed by the learned Civil Judge keeping in view the only facts stated in Para-14 of the plaint.\n\n7.         The plaint in  a  civil  suit  cannot  be considered in piecemeal for deciding an application under Order VII rule 11 CPC. This illegality of the learned Civil Judge is apparent on the record and cannot be approved by this Court. An application under Section 14 of the Limitation Act 1908 was moved by the appellant and this  fact  was  clearly  overlooked  by  the learned Civil Judge in rejecting the instant suit. The Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  a case reported as Sherin and 4 others versus\n\n\nFazal Muhammad and 4 others (1995 SCMR 584) has laid down the law that when proceedings although before a wrong forum have been instituted by the litigants and have been entertained then the act of the court is also involved in entertaining the said proceedings. It is also settled proposition of law that no one should be prejudiced by the act of the Court.\n\n8.             The  case  law  cited  by  the  learned counsel  for  the  respondent  reported  as   Haji Abdul   Karim   and   others   versus   Messrs Florida  Builders  (Pvt)  Limited  (PLD  2012 Supreme Court 247)  is distinguishable in the facts that no suit was first instituted before a wrong Court in the reported judgment which remained   pending   for   a   long   period   and thereafter the plaint was returned by the courts below  which  is  the  factual  position  in  the present case.\n\n9.             In view of the above facts, the question of bar of limitation has become a mixed question of law and fact which can only be decided by framing  an  issue  and  recording  of  evidence, therefore, the rejection of plaint by the learned Civil Judge through the impugned order dated\n\n\n24.07.2008 in the instant R.F.A is not sustainable in the eyes of law and is set aside. The suit instituted by the appellant shall be deemed to be pending before the learned Senior Civil Judge, Rawalpindi who is directed to frame the issues in the matter including the issue of bar of limitation and decide the case in accordance with law after recording the evidence of the parties.\n10.          For what has been discussed above, the R.F.A. is allowed with costs.\n\n\n\n\n(M.

The  petitioners  through  this  writ  petition  assail  orders  dated\n15.07.2013 and 26.09.2013 passed by respondents No. 1 and 2 respectively whereby the rent deed executed between the parties was impounded and  the petitioners were asked to pay, inter alia, the stamp duty on the amount of the security deposit.\n2.        Brief facts of the case are that petitioner No. 1 executed a rent deed in respect of  a  shop situated in  Commercial Zone, Liberty Market, Gulberg-III, Lahore in favour of petitioner No. 2.  The lease period was fixed for three years and the rent payable per month was Rs.150,000/-.   The lessee also agreed to submit Rs.4,000,000/- as security deposit refundable on the determination of the lease.   The rent deed was executed before the local commission on 05.07.2013 who presented the same before Sub-registrar, Gulberg Town, Lahore, respondent No. 1, on 15.07.2013 for registration.  Respondent No. 1 declined to register the rent deed as according to him there was a deficiency of Rs.80,000/- in payment of the stamp duty on account of the security deposit and a further deficiency of Rs.3720/- on account of  average annual rent.   Accordingly, vide order  dated\n15.07.2013 passed by respondent No. 1, the rent deed was impounded and forwarded to respondent No. 2, Additional Collector (Gen), Lahore for passing orders for recovery under Section 40 of the Stamp Act.  The petitioners feeling aggrieved by order dated 15.07.2013 also filed an appeal before respondent No. 2 against the said order. \n\n\n3.        Respondent No. 2 vide order dated 26.09.2013 decided the reference/appeal upholding the decision of respondent No. 1.  Respondent No. 1 accordingly sent a notice to the petitioners for payment of Rs.83,720/- in respect of deficiency of stamp duty and Rs.16,745/- as fine.  Feeling aggrieved from the afore-referred two decisions and the notice for payment of the amounts, the petitioners have filed the present writ petition.\n4.        The case of the petitioners is that the security deposit does not form part either of the rent or of the consideration for which the lease was granted. It is argued that the security deposit is refundable and, therefore, rent deed executed between the petitioners is not liable to stamp duty in terms of Article 35 (c) (i) of the First Schedule to the Stamp Act rather it is liable to stamp duty under Article\n35 (a) (ii) thereof.  The petitioners, however, admit the deficiency of Rs.3720/- on account of average annual rent.\n5.        The respondents have filed their report and parawise comments pursuant to orders passed by the Court.  A preliminary objection has been taken regarding the maintainability of the present writ petition on the ground that the remedy of the Revision petition available to the petitioners before the Chief Revenue Authority/Senior Member, Board of Revenue, Punjab has not been availed.  It is the case of the respondents that the rent deed executed between the petitioners falls under Article 35 (c) (i) of the First Schedule to the Stamp Act and the security deposit mentioned therein comes within the purview of the expression “money\nadvanced”  as  used  in  the  afore-mentioned  Article.    The  respondents  further contend that stamp duty is chargeable on the refundable security in a lease deed as per General Circular Notification No. 2701-83/846-ST(II) dated 24.01.1985 issued by the Board of Revenue, Punjab whereby the question whether security deposit is liable to stamp duty in terms of Article 35 (c) (i) of the First Schedule to the Stamp Act was referred to it as Chief Revenue Authority under the said Act. The relevant portion of the opinion is reproduced hereunder.\n“In the circumstances, the learned Member (Revenue) has ruled that the amounts of security deposited by the lessees in addition to the rent reserved bring the two leases within the mischief of Article 35 (c) (i) of schedule 1 to the Stamp Act, and, as such, have been correctly assessed to stamp duty by the Chief Collector of stamps.”\n6.        With consent of the parties, this petition is treated as a Pacca case as all the relevant material has already been brought on the record.\n7.        The  real  controversy  before  the  respondents  was  whether  the  security deposit mentioned in the rent deed executed between the petitioners brings the said \n\n\nrent deed within the mischief of Article 35 (c) (i) of Schedule 1 to the Stamp Act. Before proceeding any further in the matter, it would be expedient to refer to the following expressions used in Article 35 of the Stamp Act in connection, inter alia, with a lease.\n“where by such lease the rent is fixed and no premium is paid or delivered”\n\n(Article 35 (a) (i) of the First Schedule to the Stamp Act);\n\n“where the lease is granted for money advanced and where no rent is reserved” (Article 35 (b) (i) of the First Schedule to the Stamp Act); “where the lease is granted for a fine or premium and where no rent is reserved” (Article 35 (b) (ii) of the First Schedule to the Stamp Act); and “where  the  lease  is  granted  for  money  advanced  in  addition  to  rent reserved” (Article 35 (c) (i) of the First Schedule to the Stamp Act) “where the  lease is  granted for  a  fine or premium in  addition to  rent reserved” (Article 35 (c) (ii) of the First Schedule to the Stamp Act)\n8.        The expressions “rent”, “fine”, “premium” and “money advanced” have not\n\nbeen defined in the Stamp Act rather these expressions find mention in Section\n\n105 of the Transfer of Property Act, which reads as under:\n\n“105.  Leases defined.       A lease of immovable property is a transfer of a right to enjoy such property, made for a certain time, express or implied, or in perpetuity, in consideration of a price paid or promised, or of money, a share of crops, service or any other thing of value, to be rendered periodically or on specified occasions to the transferor by the transferee, who accepts the transfer on such terms.\nLessor, Lessee, premium and rent defined.       The transferor is called the lessor, the transferee is called the lessee, the price is called the premium, and the money, share, service or other thing to be so rendered is called the rent.”\n9.        From a bare reading of Section105 of the Transfer of Property Act, it is clear that there are two types of considerations for which a lease can be granted by a lessor to the lessee.   The first is the price paid or promised and is called the premium.  The second is the money, share of crops, service etc to be paid at stated periods or on specific occasions, which is called the rent.  The afore-mentioned section does not admit of any other type of consideration.\n10.      The definition of rent as afore-mentioned makes it clear that it is a liability payable in future, periodically or on occasions specified in the instrument executed between the parties.  However, it may be clarified that when rent is determined in the lease instrument together with a covenant to pay the same at a specified time \n\n\nand if such a liability is met by making advance payment of the entire rent, the said advance payment of rent shall still be treated as rent and not otherwise for the reason that the legal character of that payment is rent and simply because it has been paid in advance would not change its character.  The premium, on the other hand, is a price which may be paid prior to the lease or it may be price paid after the lease in consideration for the grant of lease but its promise has to be made prior to the lease.\n11.      In subcontinent, there still exits a custom in the towns of making a one time payments to the landlord for acquiring the benefits of the lease, which is often described as “Salami”, “Pagree” etc.   This custom has been explained in Chief Controlling Revenue Authority v. Marshall Produce Brokers Co. Pvt. Limited AIR  1980  Delhi  249  where  it  was  held  that  “Fine  in  relation  to  leases  is something which is to go irrevocably into the pocket of the landlord who requires it as a condition of consenting to a transfer of right to enjoy property.  Fine is indistinguishable from  premium and  is  money payment in  consideration of  a demise.  Fine paid as fine is money paid with the intention of passing over the property in it to the landlord so that it should become his.”       Later       in       the judgment, it was also held that „The legislature must be aware of money payments in consideration of the lease, when it sought to cover “fine or premium or for money advanced” in Art. 35 (b) and (c).   The words used here “for money advanced” do not connote any idea of repayment ……..  Money advanced here is money which is not to revert to the lessee.‟\nSimilarly, in Commissioner of Income Tax v. The Panbari Tea Co. Limited AIR 1965 SC 1871, while referring to Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act, it was held that “The section, therefore, bring out the distinction between a price paid for a transfer of a right to enjoy the property and the rent to be paid periodically to the lessor.   When the interest of the lessor is parted with for a price, the price paid is premium or salami.  But the periodical payments made for the continuous enjoyment of the benefits under the lease are in the nature of rent. The former is a capital income and the latter a revenue receipt.”\n12.      The  afore-mentioned  custom  has  been  given  statutory  recognition  in Section 105 of the Transfer of the Property Act.   The expressions “fine” and “premium” used in Article 35 of the Stamp Act, thus, indicate a one time irreversible payment made by the lessee to the landlord for acquiring the benefit of the  lease,  which  is  treated  as  capital  income.    It  will  also  be  seen  that  the\nexpressions “fine” and “premium” have been used interchangeably in Article 35 (b) and (c) of the Stamp Act.  The expression “for money advanced” has also been \n\n\nused only in Article 35 (b) and (c) of the Stamp Act.  It may not be out of place to mention here that the word “for” used here can only mean “in consideration of” in view of the overall scheme of Article 35 of the Stamp Act and the definition of lease in Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act wherein only two types of considerations are mentioned for the grant of lease.   This expression certainly cannot be equated to rent and, therefore, must be treated at par with or akin to premium/fine.  Thus, the expression “for money advanced” as used in Article 35 (b) and (c) of the Stamp Act also means a one time payment from the lessee to the landlord for the grant of benefit of the lease, which money is not to revert back to the lessee.\n13.      In the present case, however, the security deposit mentioned in the rent deed is to return to the lessee on the determination of the lease.   It is further stipulated, quite clearly, in the rent deed executed between the petitioners that petitioner No. 1/landlord cannot deduct rent out the said security deposit even if petitioner No. 2/lessee defaults in payment of the rent.  Can this security deposit in such a circumstance be termed as “money advanced” used in Article 35 (c) (i) of the First Schedule to the Stamp Act?  The answer is in negative.  The construction of the rent deed in question does not admit of any other conclusion except that it does not fall within the mischief of Article 35 (c) (i) of the Stamp Act and the amount of security deposit mentioned therein does not come within the expression “for money advanced”.\n14.      The  respondents  also  relied  upon  Notification  No.  2701-83/846-ST(II) dated 24.01.1985 issued by the Board of Revenue, Punjab/ Chief Revenue Authority.   In the said Notification, two judgments from the Indian jurisdiction reported as In re Chief Controlling Revenue Authority AIR 1952 Bombay 285 and Board of Revenue, Madras, Referring Authority v. M/s Simpson and Mc Conechy Limited, Madras AIR 1961 Madras 210 were relied upon by the Chief Revenue Authority in order to arrive at the conclusion that the amount of security deposit is liable to be assessed to stamp duty.   In re Chief Controlling Revenue Authority AIR 1952 Bombay 285 was a case where the applicability of Article 35 (a) (ii) and Articles 35 (b) of the Stamp Act on a lease deed was in issue and it was held therein that amounts paid to the lessor by the lessee prior to the liability of rent arising under the lease deed was an advance. It was held thus “The liability to pay rent can only arise under the lease and at stated periods or specific occasions mentioned in the lease, till the stated period or specific occasion arises, there is no liability on the part of the lessee to pay rent.   Therefore, if the lessee pays an amount in respect of the rent prior to the liability arising, that payment is nothing \n\n\nmore than advance made by the lessee to the lessor.  He makes an advance, and the agreement is that the lessor will satisfy the lessee’s liability out of that amount when that liability arises.  But the legal character of that payment is not rent, but money advanced by the lessee to the lessor.   The liability only crystallises and takes on the character of rent when the stated period or the specific occasion arrives under the lease and the lessee becomes liable to pay the rent.”   On the facts, the Bombay High Court came to the conclusion that the lease deed in question falls under Article 35 (b) and not under Article 35 (a) (ii) of the Stamp Act.  It may, however, be mentioned that in Citibank v. District Registrar/District Collector/Deputy Commissioner, Lahore and another 1999 MLD 1101, this Court to the extent of advance rent took a contrary view and held that rent paid in\nadvance does not constitute “money advanced”.   In similar circumstances, in Union of India through Chief Controlling Revenue Authority, Delhi and others v. M/s Caltex (India) Limited, New Delhi AIR 1966 Punjab 488 it was held that “An amount for which there is both a liability and a covenant to pay as rent cannot be termed as advance.  It cannot in the circumstances be said that this is a case of granting a lease for money advanced in addition to rent reserved.   The legal character of Rs.25,500 is rent and merely because that rent is paid in advance under a covenant its character does not change.”\n15.      Similarly,  in  Board  of  Revenue,  Madras,  Referring  Authority  v.  M/s Simpson and Mc Conechy Limited, Madras AIR 1961 Madras 210, the lease deed in question contained a clause whereby the lessor applied to the lessee for an advance of Rs.75,000/- for discharging the subsisting encumbrances on the property.  The said instrument also provided for rent in the sum of Rs.17,750/- per month and allowed the lessee to withhold a sum of Rs.750/- from the said amount per month for appropriating the same in liquidation of the sum of Rs.75,000/- advanced to the lessor.  On facts of that case, the Madras High Court came to the conclusion that the afore-mentioned lease instrument comes within the mischief of Article 30 (c) of Schedule 1 of the Indian Stamp Act.\n16.      It is, therefore, clear that the ratio of the above mentioned decisions relied upon by the Chief Revenue Authority/Board of Revenue are not relevant to the interpretation of Article 35 (c) (i) of the First Schedule to the Stamp Act and were wrongly pressed into service for making security deposits assessable to stamp duty.   The said decisions, in any event, are not applicable to the facts of the present case.\n17.      The respondents have also raised the preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the writ petition on the ground that the remedy of revision \n\n\nbefore the Chief Revenue Officer is available to the petitioners against the order of respondent No. 2.  I am also not ready to accept the preliminary objection raised by  the  respondents.    The  remedy  of  revision  was  meaningless  as  the  Chief Revenue Authority, as mentioned above, has already expressed its opinion against the stance of the petitioners in the Notification relied upon by the respondents. Furthermore, aAs a question of law is involved in this writ petition and keeping in view the established position that it is the duty of the superior Courts to interpret law, the objection of the respondents regarding the maintainability of the writ petition is repelled.  Reference in this regard is made to the judgment reported as Attock Cement Pakistan Limited v. Collector of Customs, Collectorate of Customs and Central Excise, Quetta etc 1999 PTD 1892.\n18.      In the result, this writ petition is accepted and it is held that the rent deed executed between the petitioners and the amount of security deposit mentioned therein does  not  come  within  the  mischief  of  Article 35  (c)  (i)  of  the  First Schedule to the Stamp Act.  Accordingly, orders dated 15.07.2013 and 26.09.2013 passed by respondents No. 1 and 2 respectively are set aside being without lawful authority and of no legal effect.   The petitioners shall, of course, make up the\nadmitted deficiency of Rs.3720/- in the stamp duty on the instrument in question.\n\n\n \nApproved for reporting.\n \n\n\nJUDGE: \n\n\n\nAnnounced in open Court today on   \n\n\n\nJUDGE:\n"\n', 'AIR 1980 Delhi 249,AIR 1965 SC 1871,1999 MLD 1101,AIR 1966 Punjab 488,1999 PTD 1892,AIR 1952 Bombay 285,AIR 1961 Madras 210', 'PLD-2014-Lahore-548.pdf'),

The facts germane for the disposal of the instant civil revisions are that Muhammad Yasin petitioner (hereinafter will be referred as plaintiff) filed a suit for declaration against Muhammad Jamil and Saidan Bibi respondents (hereinafter will be referred as defendants) with the assertion that the disputed property was owned by Majeed s/o Karman (the description of the property is fully mentioned in para-1 of the plaint), who was an old age person and also due to  brain paralysis in the beginning of March 1993  he became  incapable  of  speaking,  moving  and  thinking.  He  also became unconscious in the last twenty five days of his life and ultimately he died on 05.4.1993, that defendant No.1 Muhammad Jamil was the nephew of the deceased whereas defendant No.2\n\n  \n\nSaidan Bibi was his widow, that defendant No.1 got entered Rapt Roznamcha dated 22.3.1993 and thereafter mutation of oral gift No.519 dated 27.3.1993 in his favour in connivance with Revenue officials and the said Rapt as well as the disputed mutation were product of fraud as at that time the alleged donor Majeed was not capable of making offer of gift and the said deceased did not get entered the said rapt or got attested the disputed mutation as he was suffering from Marz-al-Maut. The said suit was resisted by the defendant Muhammad Jamil by filing his written statement. No doubt the said written statement also bears the name of Saidan Bibi the other defendant but it transpired from the record that latter on defendant No.2 denied the filing of the said written statement alongwith Muhammad Jamil defendant No.1.\n\n\n\n3.                 The learned trial court captured the disputed area of facts by striking following issues:-\n\n\n\n1.  Whether  the  mutation  No.519  dated\n\n\n\n27.3.1993 was got sanctioned by the deceased Majeed during Marzul Maut?OPP\n\n\n\n2.  If issue No.1 is proved in affirmative, so, its effect?OPP\n\n\n\n3.  Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the decree of declaration and possession\n\n\n\nas well as permanent injunction as prayed for?OPP\n\n\n\n4.  Whether the plaintiff has got no cause of action?OPD\n\n\n\n5.  Whether this suit is improperly valued for the purposes of court fee and jurisdiction, if so, what is real valuation of this suit?OPD\n\n\n\n6.  Whether   this   suit   is   hit   by   the provisions of Section 172 of the land Revenue Act?OPD\n\n\n\n7. Whether  this  suit  is  false  and frivolous,     if     so,     whether     the\n\n  \n\ndefendants are entitled to recover the special costs u/s m35-A of CPC?OPD\n\n\n\n8.  Relief.\n\n  \n\n4.                 Both the parties produced their evidence before the learned trial court in pros and cons and ultimately the suit was dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 16.3.2001. Being aggrieved  the plaintiff filed  an  appeal before the learned  lower appellate court and the learned lower appellate court vide judgment and decree dated 6.5.2004 declared the gift as a valid transaction only to the extent of 1/3 share of the disputed property whereas the rest of the disputed property was declared the legacy of deceased and was to be inherited by legal heirs according to Islamic shares. The plaintiff filed Civil Revision No.2147 of 2004 and defendant No.1 filed Civil Revision No.1369 of 2004 against the said judgments and decrees passed by both the courts below, which are being disposed of jointly this single judgment.\n\n\n\n5.                 The learned counsel for the plaintiff has argued that both the courts below while passing the impugned judgments and decrees did not consider that onus of issues No.1 & 2 was on the parties and the plaintiff produced best available evidence to discharge his part of onus, but in its rebuttal the defendant No.1 failed to discharge his onus, therefore, the impugned judgments and decrees passed by both the courts below are not sustainable, that deceased was an ailing person having 70/72 years age who died just after 8/9 days of the so called execution of oral gift and these facts coupled with the late/ailing age of the deceased itself would show that the deceased was suffering from a disease which could be fatal,\n\n  \n\nas such proceedings, of oral gift were made in a hasty manner which casted shadow of doubt on the conduct of defendant No.1, that both the courts below while passing the impugned judgments also   overlooked   the   statement   of   DW7   (Muhammad   Jamil defendant No.1) that deceased was suffering from brain paralysis, that once it was admitted by defendant No.1 being DW7 that deceased did suffer from brain paralysis thus onus heavily shifted on him to prove that he was capable of making valid gift by the production of medical evidence regarding his treatment. He lastly prayed that the impugned judgments and decrees passed by both the courts below being result of misreading and non-reading are liable to be set aside by declaring the same illegal, unlawful and without jurisdiction. The learned counsel for the plaintiff has relied upon the judgments reported as KHAN MUHAMMAD VS. MUHAMMAD DIN THROUGH LRS (2010 SCMR 1351), MUHAMMAD AKRAM AND ANOTHER VS. ALTAF AHMAD (PLD 2003 SC 688), HAJI ILAHI BAKHSH VS. NOOR MUHAMMAD AND OTHERS (PLD 1985 SC 41), ZULFIQAR AND OTHERS VS. SHAHDAT KHAN (PLD 2007 SC 582), ALLAH WASAYA AND ANOTHER VS. FALAK SHER AND ANOTHER (2001 CLC 280), MUHAMMAD MAQBOOL VS. MUHAMMAD AKBAR AND OTHERS (1999 MLD 2536), WAQQAR  AMBALVI  VS.  FAQIR  ALI  AND  OTHERS  (1969\n\n\n\nSCMR 189), CHIEF ENGINEER, IRRIGATION DEPARTMENT, N.W.F.P. PESHAWAR AND 2 OTHERS VS. MAZHAR  HUSSAIN  AND  2  OTHERS  (PLD  2004  SC  682),\n\n  \n\nHAFIZ TASSADUQ HUSSAIN VS. LAL KHATOON AND OTHERS (PLD 2011 SC 296), MST. CHANAN BIBI AND 4\n\n\n\nOTHERS  VS.  MUHAMMAD  SHAFI  AND  3  OTHERS  (PLD\n\n  \n\n1977 SC 28), NOOR MUHAMMAD KHAN AND 3 OTHERS VS. HABIBULLAH KHAN AND 27 OTHERS (PLD 1994 SC 650), KARAM BEGUM AND 3 OTHERS VS. ALLAH DITTA AND 3\n\n\n\nOTHERS (PLD 1986 SC (AJ & K) 27), MUHAMMAD BAKHSH VS. ELLAHI BUKHSH AND OTHERS (2003 SCMR 286), BARKAT ALI THROUGH LEGAL HEIRS AND OTHERS (2002\n\n\n\nSCMR 1938) and MUKHTAR AHMAD VS. MST. RASHEEDA BIBI AND ANOTHER (2003 SCMR 1664) to contend that the suit was liable to be decreed as a whole.\n\n\n\n6.                 Conversely the learned counsel for the defendant has argued that heavy onus was laid upon the plaintiff to prove that deceased having been affected with mental incapacity and physical infirmity could not constitute a valid gift as an independent person, but he neither produced any medical certificate nor the physician to discharge  the  onus  of  issue  No.1,  that  the  learned  Additional District Judge after holding that mutation was properly sanctioned could not held that the gift had been made by the deceased during Marzul Maut, that the learned lower appellate court has failed to consider that when the parties adduced their evidence and onus of issue No.1 was on the parties, which loses its significance, that the learned  lower  appellate  court  without  assessing  the  material available on file has passed the impugned judgment and decree on erroneous premises of law. The learned counsel for the defendant\n\n  \n\nrelied upon the judgments reported as JEWAN KHAN AND OTHERS VS. FEROZE (PLD 1951 LAHORE 433), MST. JIVANEE  VS.  FEROZE  DIN  AND  ANOTHER  (PLD  1962\n\n\n\nW.P.(REV.54), MST. CHANAN BIBI AND 4 OTHERS VS. MUHAMMAD SHAFI AND 3 OTHERS (PLD 1977 SC 28). He lastly prayed for setting aside of the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned lower appellate court and prayed for restoration of the judgment and decree passed by the learned trial court.\n\n\n\n7.                 Arguments heard and record perused.\n\n  \n\n8.                 It is an admitted fact that Majeed s/o Karman was the owner of the disputed property and he died on 5.4.1993 leaving behind his brother/plaintiff, widow Saidan Bibi defendant No.1 and his nephew Muhammad Jamil defendant No.1. His death was got entered   in   the   relevant   register   of   death   on   20.5.1993   by Muhammad Jamil defendant No.1. This document is available on file as Exh.D8 at page 64. The column No.8 is relevant, which assigned the reason of death as brain paralysis. It is significant that the said entry was got recorded by defendant No.1 himself and prior  to  the  death  of  deceased  Majeed  a  Rapt  in  Roznamcha Waqiati of the Patwari   Exh.D2 was alleged to be got entered on\n\n\n\n22.3.1993 by the alleged donor Majeed deceased. It is also admitted by the counsel for the defendant No.1 that mutation of gift No.519\n\n\n\nExh.D1 was attested by the Revenue Officer on 27.3.1993 in the absence of alleged donor Majeed deceased on the strength of Rapt\n\n  \n\nRoznamcha Exh.D2. These documents Exh.D1 & D2 are relevant for consideration by this Court.\n\n\n\n9.                 To  prove the fact that deceased  had been  suffering from   mental   incapacity/brian   paralysis,   the   plaintiff   himself appeared as PW1 and produced Muhammad Usman as PW2. Both the said PWs categorically deposed in their examination in chief that deceased had been affected with mental infirmity and also a man of old age. The said portion of their deposition has not been cross examined by defendant No.1. It is a settled principle of law that if a material fact has been deposed in the examination in chief, but is not questioned during the cross examination, the same shall be deemed to have been admitted in view of the dictum laid down by the superior Courts in  the judgments reported as  WAQQAR AMBALVI VS. FAQIR ALI AND OTHERS (1969 SCMR 189), CHIEF ENGINEER, IRRIGATION DEPARTMENT, N.W.F.P. PESHAWAR AND 2 OTHERS VS. MAZHAR HUSSAIN AND 2\n\n\n\nOTHERS (PLD 2004 SC 682), (2009 YLR 289), (2000 MLD 404), (PLD 1967 LAHORE 1138) and (PLD 2011 SC 296).\n\n\n\n10.               The deposition of PW1 & PW2 is further corroborated by Ali Jan PW3, who was Lumberdar of the village while stating that entry of death in register of death (Exh.D8) maintained by him was got entered by defendant No.1 himself after appearing before him. The said entry was thereafter incorporated in the register of death maintained by the Secretary Union Council. The perusal of basic  document  Exh.P3  &  P4  maintained  by  village  headman depicts that in column No.10 of the said register the duration of\n\n  \n\nailment of the deceased was shown to be 25 days whereas such duration was not shown in the copy of register of death Exh.D8, which was maintained by Union Council concerned. The bird’s eye view of the said death certificate (Exh.D8) depicts that column of duration of ailment was not visible and has been intentionally omitted to be photocopied as the other columns are shown in seriatim but the said column is missing. To prove the  cause of death, the plaintiff produced relevant Lumberdar Ali Jan as PW3 who corroborated the entry of Exh.P3 & P4. The said PW was cross examined by the counsel for the defendant No.1 but the veracity of his evidence could not be shaken\n\n\n\n11.               To rebut the evidence of said PW3, defendant No.1 produced Nasir Mehmood, Secretary Union, Council as DW8, who deposed that in his register column No.10 regarding the duration of ailment was left blank by the former Secretary, Union Council and only dash was marked in the said column. Nasir Mehmood DW8 was not a concerned person who had entered death entry of the deceased  Majeed  rather  during  the  cross-examination  it  was clarified that Abdul Karim Chaudhry, Secretary, Union Council had entered the said entry, but the said Secretary was not produced by defendant No.1 to prove the contents of Exh.D8. As a column of duration of ailment was provided in Exh.D8 and Exh.P3 and in the initial record maintained by Lumberdar the duration of ailment was mentioned, which has been proved by the said Lumberdar, the non- mentioning of duration of ailment in the register of death by Secretary,  Union  Council  which  has  also  not  been  proved  by\n\n  \n\nproducing the relevant Secretary, Union Council an inference can be drawn that prior entry made in the register of Lumberdar had a preference  over  the  entry  which  was  subsequently  made  by Secretary Union Council on the basis of the record maintained by the Lumberdar but omitted to copy the duration of ailment of the deceased.\n\n\n\n12.               The contention of learned counsel for defendant No.1 that plaintiff was under obligation to prove the fact that at the time of entry of Rapt Roznamcha and attestation of mutation regarding the gift of disputed property, the donor was suffering from death illness was on the plaintiff, but he failed to prove the said fact is misconceived. Marzul Maut means a disease aggravated that deceased person apprehended that death was more probable than a chance to live, it was only where a person had become so much aggravated that  he was  depending  to  apprehend  that  death  was more  probable  than  his  chance  to  live, then  the person  can  be considered to be suffering from Marzul Maut.\n\n\n\n13.               The plaintiff proved the said fact by producing PW1 & P2, whose testimony to the extent that Majeed had been suffering from death illness has not been cross examined and deemed to be admitted by defendant No.1 as observed supra. The said oral evidence has also been supported by the  documentary evidence (Exh.P3 & P4) wherein duration of ailment of said deceased spread over twenty five days and the entry of Rapt Roznamcha Waqiati Exh.D2 and attestation of mutation Exh.D1 definitely fell in the said duration. The defendant No.1 in his written statement denied\n\n  \n\nthe old age of deceased Majeed at the time of his death, but same has also been affirmed by death entry as mentioned in Exh.P3 & P4 and exh.D8 that deceased was almost about 70 years of age at the time of his death. After reading entire evidence available on file it does not appeal to a prudent man that Majeed deceased at the age of\n\n\n\n70 years while confined to bed had the mental capacity to make an intelligent decision with regard to his landed property. Muhammad Jamil  defendant  No.1  had  a  motive  to  usurp  the  property  of deceased to deprive the other legal heirs of Majeed deceased, who at the relevant time was admittedly living with defendant Muhammad Jamil and totally dependent on him. The Rapt Roznamcha Waqiati Exh.D2 was got recorded on 22.3.1993 and the mutation was attested on 27.3.1993 whereas Majeed took his last breathe  on  5.4.1993  after  8/9  days  of  the  attestation  of  said mutation.\n\n\n\n14.               In the above fact and circumstances of the case it is proved that on 22.3.1993 and 27.3.1993, at the time of entry of the Rapt Roznamcha Waqiati and attestation of mutation, Majeed deceased had been suffering from Marzul Maut, who was not a person  competent to  make an  intelligent decision, hence the so called transaction reflected in the Rapt Roznamcha Waqiati as well as in the mutation in my view was hit by the vice of mischief and has also could not be proved by defendant No.1 Muhammad Jamil. Reliance in this respect can be placed upon the judgments reported as (1999 SCMR 1049), (1992 SCMR 553) and MUHAMMAD SIDDIQUE AND 3 OTHERS VS. MUHAMMAD BOOTA AND\n\n  \n\nOTHERS (2009 MLD 917). The case law cited by the learned counsel for the defendant No.1 is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the instant case.\n\n\n\n15.               The plaintiff (PW1) stated on oath that disputed Rapt Roznamcha Waqiati as well as mutation (Exh.D2 & D3) were result of fraud and connivance, thus the onus was shifted upon defendant No.1 to prove the transaction of gift independently as well as the attestation of mutation and entry of Rapt in dispute. The defendant No.1 did not plead any of the three ingredients of gif in his written statement that when, where and in whose presence the oral transaction of gift was effected as he failed to give any date, time, venue and even the name of witnesses. Furthermore the defendant also failed to prove the transaction of gift through his evidence. There must be an offer on behalf of the donor regarding the gift of the disputed property to the donee and that offer must be accepted by the alleged donee and possession of the disputed property was also to be handed over by the donor to the donee, which should be followed by the subsequent event that the said transaction was reported to the patwari for the entry of the same in the register Roznamcha Waqiati and attestation of mutation. The beneficiary/defendant No.1 was bound to prove the alleged transaction of gift as well as the following events by producing reliable and cogent evidence and in the absence of such proof, the mutation of oral gift No.519 in favour of defendant No.1 is liable to be cancelled. Reliance in this respect is placed upon the judgments reported as (2010 SCMR 1351), (PLD 2003 SC 688), (PLD 1985\n\n  \n\nSC 41) and (PLD 2007 SC 582). The findings rendered by the learned courts below on issues No.1 to 3 are erroneous and not supported by the evidence on the record as well as the law on the subject. Even the learned lower appellate court has passed the contradictory order as on the one hand it was observed that the transaction of gift was made by Abdul Majeed deceased during Marz-al-Maut, but surprisingly the disputed gift was upheld to the extent 1/3rd of the property whereas in such an eventuality the same was to be declared null and void as a whole because in view of the observation of this Court in the preceding paras, having been falling in the state of Marz-al-Maut due to paralysis of brain, was unable to make intelligent decision with regard to this landed property. As such the findings of the learned courts below on issues No.1 to 3, which are inter linked with each other, are reversed and the said issues are decided in favour of the petitioner/plaintiff. However,\n\n\n\nremaining issues No.4 to 7 were already answered by the learned trial court against the defendant/respondent No.1 and the said findings were not challenged by filing any cross-objections, hence the said findings cannot be re-opened when the learned counsel for respondent No.1/defendant has also failed to contradict the said findings of the learned trial court from any evidence available on the record.\n\n\n\n16.               Sequel of the above discussion is that the instant civil revision is allowed, the judgments and decrees passed by both the courts below are set aside and the suit filed by the plaintiff is decreed with costs throughout. The suit property will be devolved upon all the legal heirs of Abdul Majeed deceased according to\n\n  \n\ntheir legal shares. The civil revision No.1369 of 2004 filed by the defendant is dismissed.\n\n     \n\n(CH.

Election  Commission  of  Pakistan  (“ECP”)  vide Notification dated 26.09.2012 issued under Sections 11 and 108 of Representation of the People Act, 1976 (“ROPA”) read with sub article (4) of Article 224 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973  (“Constitution”)    announced  the Bye-Elections in the following constituencies of National Assembly of  Pakistan,  as  well  as,  Provincial  Assemblies  of\nPunjab and Sindh:-\n\n\nNATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF PAKISTAN\n\n1. \nNA-107 Gujrat-IV\n\n2. \nNA-162 Sahiwal-III\n\n3. \nNA-245 Karachi-VII\n\nPROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY OF PUNJAB\n\n1. \nPP-26 Jhelum-III\n\n2. \nPP-92 Gujranwala-II\n\n3. \nPP-122 Sialkot-II\n\n4. \nPP-144 Lahore-VIII\n\nPROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY OF SINDH\n\n1. \nPS-21 Naushero Feroze-III\n\n3.       According  to  the  Notification  polling  day  of  Bye- Elections was scheduled for 17.11.2012. Subsequently, vide impugned Notification dated 08.11.2012 (“Impugned Notification”)   issued under Section 11A of ROPA read with Article 254 of the Constitution, the polling date of Bye- Elections was ‘refixed’ as 04.12.2012.\n4.       Grievance of the petitioners, who are elector (voter) and candidate from two of the aforesaid constituencies namely; NA-\n162 Sahiwal-III and PP-122 Sialkot-II, respectively, is that new election schedule issued under the Impugned Notification is in \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviolation of Article 224(4) of the Constitution, in as much as, the Bye-Elections ought to be held within 60 days from the date the seat fell vacant.  He submits that vacancy in the present case occurred on 20.09.2012 in pursuance to the judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi’s Case (C.P. No.5 of 2012), hence, Bye-Elections should have been called within two months i.e., latest by 20.11.2012, however, due to amendment/re-fixation of the election schedule under the Impugned Notification, the polling date has been extended to 04.12.2012 which falls outside the permissible constitutional  period  of  60  days,  hence  the  Bye-Elections cannot be held.   Supplementing the above argument, learned counsel submitted that the Constitution prescribes that elections ought to be held not later than 120 days before the expiry of the term of the government.   The term, of both the Assemblies, expires on 16.03.2013 and the election date is announced as\n04.12.2012, hence less than 120 days are left between the elections and the completion of the term of the Assemblies, therefore, holding the Bye-Elections under the Impugned Notification is unconstitutional.\n5.       It was vehemently argued by the learned counsel for the petitioners that  Article  224(4)  of the Constitution  has  to  be interpreted  in  favour of  the  electorate.    It  is  submitted  that reading of the said article in its literal sense leads to absurdity, in as much as, the Bye Elections cannot be held if less than 120 days  remain  before the term of  the  Assemblies  expires.  He submits  that  the entire  exercise  amounts  to  wastage of tax- payers  money  which  is  to  be  spent  on  preparation  and conducting of elections and no useful purpose will be achieved as   the   term   of   the   retuned   candidate   in   the   respective Assemblies will be less than 120 days. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.       It is further contended that in changing the date from\n\n17.11.2012 to 04.12.2012 the Election Commission has failed to consider the fact that the limited election expenses in a sum of  Rs  1.0  million  for  the  Provincial  Assembly  and  Rs  1.5 million for the National Assembly have been exhausted and there are no funds available with the candidates to carry out their campaign during the period of extension (i.e., 17-days) which has seriously impaired their right to contest the elections.\n7.       On the interpretation of Article 224(4) of the Constitution it is submitted that the fundamental tenet of interpretation is that   where ordinary interpretation or literal meaning of the words  would  create  inconsistency,  inconvenience  and absurdity, the Court may depart from the ordinary interpretation or the literal meaning of the words. In support of this, reliance has been placed on Jamat-i-Islami Pakistan through Syed Munawar Hassan Secretary General v. Federation of Pakistan through  Secretary,  Law,  Justice  and  Parliamentary  Affairs (PLD 2000 SC 111),  Sardar Khan Niazi v. District Coordination Officer, Multan and 4 others (PLD 2006 Lahore\n638),  Khalid Qureshi and 5 others v. United Bank Limited I.I. Chundrigar Road, Karachi (2001 SCMR 103).\n8.       Learned   counsel   submitted   that   the   word   “shall” appearing in Article 224(4) of the Constitution is not mandatory but directory as mandatory interpretation of the word ‘shall’ appearing in the above article causes severe inconvenience.  He placed reliance on   Muhammad Saleh v. The Chief Settlement Commissioner,  Lahore  and  2  others  (PLD  1972  SC  326), Majid Bukhari v. The State (PLD 2000 Lahore 108) in support of this contention.\n9.    Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that constitutional words and phrases should receive broader and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwider interpretation for realizing the social, economic and political vision encapsulated in the Constitution. The approach of the Court should be dynamic, progressive and liberal keeping in view the changed circumstances. In support of this he relied on:   Munir Hussain Bhatti, Advocate and others v. Federation of Pakistan and another (PLD 2011 SC 407,  Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd. and others v. Government of N.W.F.P. through Secretary  Law  and  others  (PLD  2002  SC  460),   Sardar Bahadur Khan Bangulzai and others v. Sardar Attaullah Khan Mengal and another (1999 SCMR 1921), Al-Jehad Trust through Raeesul Mujahideen Habib-ul-Wahabb-ul-Khairi and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 1996 SC\n324),  The Mumbai Kamgar Sabha, Bombay v. M/s Abdulbhai Faizullabhai and others,   (AIR 1976 SC 1455),  Abdul Aziz alias Labha and others v. The Province of West Pakistan (PLD\n1958  S.C.  (Pak.)  499),   Mohammad  Nur  Husain  v.  The\n\nProvince of East Pakistan and others (PLD 1959 SC (Pak.)\n\n470),  Mian Manzoor Ahmad Wattoo v. Federation of Pakistan and 3 ohers (PLD 1997 Lahore 38).\n10.     Learned Counsel also placed reliance on section 151A of the Indian Representation of the People Act, 1951 which provides   for  the  time  limit   for  filling   vacancies  to  the assemblies and prescribes that the vacancy should be filled if the remainder term of a member in relation to a vacancy is NOT less than one year.\n11.     Learned counsel for respondent No.4 raised a preliminary objection that the instant petition is not maintainable in terms of Article 225 of the Constitution and has placed reliance on Election  Commission  of  Pakistan  through  its  Secretary  v. Javaid Hashmi and others (PLD 1989 SC 396),  Rana Aftab Ahmad Khan v. Muhammad Ajmal and another (PLD 2010 SC\n1066) and  Malik Javed Akhter alias Javed Awan v. Returning \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficer  Constituency  No.PP-157,  Lahore-XXI  and  2  others (2004 YLR 1459).   On merits he contends that period of 60 days mentioned in Article 224(4) of the Constitution is a directory provision in terms of Article 254 of the Constitution. In support of this he has placed reliance on  Reference No.1 of\n1988, Made by the President of Pakistan under Article 186 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (PLD 1989\nSC 75) and  Zahur Textile Mills Ltd. V. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 1999 SC 880).    He, therefore, submits that the impugned schedule of Bye-Election is within the parameters of  Article  224(4)  of  the  Constitution  and  the  said  Bye- Elections are permissible under the Constitution.\n\n12.     Learned  Additional  Attorney  General  for  Pakistan  on notice under Order 27-A of CPC representing the Attorney General for Pakistan, as well as, Federal Government supports the earlier Notification of the ECP dated 26.09.2012, however, he has somewhat half-heartedly also supported the second Notification. As the position taken by the learned Additional Attorney General for Pakistan was not clear, he was asked to submit his position in writing, which is reproduced hereunder and the letter placed on the record as Mark “A”;\n\n“The Election Commission of Pakistan has submitted a report in aid of holding of bye-elections on 4th December, 2012.  This Election is in respect of the vacant seats of National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies.  Holding of this election is within\nthe parameters of Article 224 (4) which speaks of elections to be held within sixty days of the vacancy of seats not later than\n120 days before the expiry of the term of the Assemblies.\n\nIn  this  case,  the  cut-off  dates  according  to  the  Election\nCommission are 16.11.12 for the National Assembly Seats and\n08.12.12 for the Provincial Assemblies.   The lapse, if any is sought to be taken care by Article 254 of the Constitution read with Section 11-A of ROPA.\n\nBe that as it may, Article 254 would be attracted after the holding of the election and not before that.\n\nEx-facie, the first notification dated 26.09.12 was within the parameters of Article 224 (4) in all respects.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.     Learned Additional Advocate General Punjab was also asked to assist the Court. He made the following submissions:\n\ni.        Article 224 (4) of the Constitution is unequivocal and has to be mandatorily followed even in the presence  of  Article 254  of  the  Constitution.  He submitted that the term ‘immediate’ in Article 224 (1) makes it incumbent for the general elections to take place within the stipulated cut-off date.  It is, therefore, for this reason that the period of 120 days provided in article 224(4) of the Constitution has to be strictly construed and cannot be deviated from.   Otherwise, it will result in two elections being held in a constituency within a period of four months.   It is this aspect against which the constitution makers have guarded the voters and the citizens by providing cut-off dates.  These cut- off dates are therefore not to be treated as redundant.\n\nii.       The presence of Article 254 of the Constitution does not take away anything from the above argument because Article 254 is in the nature of a deeming clause and protects and sanctifies action taken under the Constitution but beyond the stipulated  time  period  provided  by  the Constitution. While it may be a good defence it cannot be used as a frontal attack to encourage, legitimize and perpetuate an unconstitutional act.\n\niii.     Article  6  of  the  Constitution  is  attracted  as  an attempt  is  being  made  to  transgress  the Constitution. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niv.      It is submitted that the present elections will, in any case, not ensure meaningful representation in that  there may be  no  or little time  left  for any legislative business. Hence, article 224(4) of the Constitution has to be seen in this context. The time period, if not read strictly, will offend  the principle  of  proportionality    in  as  much  as  the entire exercise of holding bye-elections will be futile and will achieve no purpose.\n\n14.     I have deliberated on the questions raised above and hold as follows:\n\nPRELIMINARY OBJECTION\n\n\n15.     The  preliminary  objection  raised  by the respondent  is based on Article 225 of the Constitution and supported by the ratio laid down in  Javaid  Hash mi ’s  Case (PLD 1989 SC 396). It is argued that the only remedy available to the petitioner is to file an election petition under Section 52 of ROPA, hence, the instant petition is not maintainable.\n\n16.     The rigour and ambit of Article 225 of the Constitution has been redefined and refashioned over the years. The jurisprudence on the question as it stands today is that interference can be made by this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution if the order under challenge is without lawful authority, corum non-judice and based on malafide.   In this regard reliance is placed on  Federation of Pakistan and others v. Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and others (PLD 2009 SC \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n644)1   wherein  Tassaduq  Hussain  Jillani  J.  speaking  for  the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:\n\n“47.     After the judgment of Javed Hashmi’s case (ibid), this Court had provided a limited window in writ jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution to challenge an order passed by a functionary of the Election Commission during currency of the election process or after the said process is over, provided the  said  order  is  patently illegal,  the  law  does  not  provide remedy either before or after the election process and if the order relates to disqualification of a candidate, the alleged disqualification is floating on surface requiring no further probe…………”\n\nThe above view is supported by the earlier judgments of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as   Let.-Gen. (R) Salahuddin Tirmizi v. Election Commission of Pakistan (2008\nSCMR 735)2,  Ayatullah Dr. Imran Liaquat Hussain v. Election\n\nCommission of Pakistan, Islamabad and another (PLD 2005\n\nSC 52)3,  Aftab Shahban Mirani v. President of Pakistan and others   (1998   SCMR   1863)4,    Ghulam   Mustafa   Jatoi   v. Additional District & Sessions Judge/Returning Officer, N.A.\n158, Naushero Feroze and others (1994 SCMR 1299)5.   The dissenting view of Nasim Hasan Shah J. in   Ja vaid  Has h mi’s \nCase, is also instructive and is reproduced hereunder:-\n\n\n“I cannot, speaking with utmost respect, agree with the view that since Article 225 by its mandate creates an independent jurisdiction (an Election Tribunal) for redress of grievances in regard to election disputes and the Constitution intends that all questions of law and facts must be decided by it, in the exercise of that jurisdiction; redress of every grievance relevant to an election  dispute  must  perforce  be  sought  by  an  election petition, after the process of election is over.   In my humble opinion such width and amplitude cannot be read into the provisions of Article 225.   I am, on the other hand, of the opinion that any decision or order made by a functionary charged with the conduct of elections which is made in excess of his authority, being coram non judice, would still be subject\n\n\n1 Five Member Bench.\n2 Five Member Bench.\n3 Three Member Bench.\n4 Three Member Bench.\n5 Five Member Bench. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto the control of the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 199. The legislature expects every statutory authority to act within the limits of the law and if any such authority steps out of these limits or refuses to function as the law requires him to function and he proceeds to make an order not within the limits of the law; such an order can be declared under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  as  without  lawful authority and to be of no legal effect.\n\nIt is, no doubt true, that the election process must be completed expeditiously and that the constitution of the assembly should  be distinctly and  speedily known and  that interference by the High Court at the intermediate stage can interrupt this process.  But it must also be remembered that the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 199 is discretionary.  The High Court can, therefore, be expected in the sound exercise of its discretion not to interfere at the intermediate stage unless it is absolutely essential to do so in the interest of justice, maintenance of purity of elections, supremacy of law and to prevent arbitrariness.   The High Court mindful of its duty in this respect can legitimately be expected to desist from interfering in the election process, unless it is entirely imperative—an expectation fully vindicated by the exemplary restraint and responsibility exhibited by it in the recent case of the dissolution of the National and Provincial Assemblies (Muhammad Sharif v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1988 Lah.\n725).\n\nWhile I agree that it is most desirable that the election process should not be interrupted during the intermediate stage, I cannot agree that to  avoid the complications of any such interference a blanket ban should be read into Article 225 to every litigative challenge made to every kind of illegal order passed by an election authority.   The law laid down in this respect by Courts in Pakistan and reiterated in the recent judgment of the Full Court in Federation of Pakistan v. Ghulam Mustafa Khar (PLD 1989 SC 26) is otherwise.  Herein it was observed that “this Article 270-A does not take away the jurisdiction of the High Courts from reviewing acts, actions or proceeding which suffered from defect of jurisdiction or were coram non judice or were mala fide.   For this purpose it is unnecessary to draw a distinction between malice in fact and malice in law”.   Accordingly,  I would,  therefore, hold that orders passed even by election authorities, which are outside the limits of the law, are not immune from challenge and correction, by the High Court under Article 199.  Undoubtedly, in doing so the High Court will exercise its jurisdiction with extreme circumspection, in full consciousness of the normal rule that it should not interfere with the process of the elections at an intermediate stage, but leave it to the Tribunal to correct all errors committed after the election is over.”   (emphasis supplied) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.     On the basis of the consistent view maintained by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan, the preliminary objection\nraised by the respondent is overruled.\n\n ON MERITS\n\n18.     The questions that require determination by this Court are as follows:-\na.  Whether Bye-Elections can be held after 60 days from the date of occurrence of the vacancy as prescribed in article 224(4) of the Constitution?\n\nb. Whether there should be clear 120 days between the polling date and the date of the expiry of the terms of the assemblies?\n\nc.  Whether adverse financial impact on the budget of election expenses due to extension in polling date is a ground to annul Bye-Elections ?\n\n19.     Article 224 (4) of the Constitution states as follows:-\n\n(4)       When, except by dissolution of the National Assembly or a Provincial Assembly, a general seat in any such Assembly has become vacant not later than one hundred and twenty days before the term of that Assembly is due to expire, an election to fill the seat shall be held within sixty days from the occurrence of the vacancy.\n\nThe above Article is invoked if a general seat of the National Assembly or Provincial Assembly falls vacant, except by the dissolution of National Assembly or the Provincial Assembly, not later than 120 days before the terms of the Assembly is to expire. A minimum period of 120 days is required between the date of occurrence of vacancy and the date of expiry of the term of the Assembly. Therefore, if a general seat falls vacant when the time between the date of occurrence of the vacancy and the date of expiry of the term of the Assembly is less than 120 days, Bye-Elections to the National Assembly or Provincial Assemblies cannot be held under Article 224(4) of the Constitution. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20.     What then is the wisdom and scheme of the Constitution in  providing  these  timelines?  Let  us  take  a  hypothetical situation where the seat of a member of Assembly falls vacant on 120th  day from the date of expiry of the Assembly.  Under Article 224 (4) the Bye-Elections have to be held within 60 days from the occurrence of the vacancy.   If “Election” is to cover the “entire process culminating in a candidate being elected” as per  Ja vaid  Has h mi ’s  Case (PLD 1989 SC 396), the remaining  period  of  60  days  is  available  for  the  returned candidate to sit in the Assembly and represent the constituency. However, closer look of sub-articles 224(1) and 224(2) of the Constitution read with Section 42 of ROPA show that the term “election” does not include the time spent in the announcement of the result of the election for which an extra period of 14 days has  been  envisaged  in  the  above  sub-articles.  Therefore,  a period of 74 days (60 days + 14  days) is spent on electing a candidate against a vacant seat and the remaining period for the returned  candidate to  sit  in  the  Assembly and  represent  the constituency is reduced to 46 days ( i.e., 120 days -74 days = 46 days).  The constitutional mandate under Article 224 (4) of the\nConstitution appears to be that unless 46 days or more are available for a candidate to sit in the Assembly, Bye-Elections\ncannot be held.  In the present case the dates are as follows:\n\nDate of vacancy of the seat: 20.09.2012\nDate of expiry of the\nNational Assembly: 16.03.2013\nTotal time between the two dates: 177 days\nPolling date: 04.12.2012\nResults expected on: 18.12.2012    (within\n14 days)\nTime left from 18.12.2012 till 16.03.2012: 88 days (as opposed to the constitutional\nminimum    of    46 days)\n\nIn the case of the Provincial Assemblies: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate of vacancy of the seat 20.09.2012\nDate of expiry of the\nProvincial Assembly: 08.04.2013\nTotal time between the two dates: 200 days\nPolling date: 04.12.2012\nResults expected on: 18.12.2012\n(within 14 days)\nTime left from 18.12.2012 till 08.04.2013 111    days    (as opposed  to  the\nconstitutional\nminimum of 46 days)\n\n21.     The  argument  that  120  days  must  exist  between  the polling date and the date when the term of the assemblies expire is fallacious and does not flow from the Constitution. Article\n224(4) of the Constitution clearly states that the period of 120 days start from the date of the occurrence of the vacancy.\n\n22.     The next question pertains to holding of the bye-election within the constitutional period of 60 days from the occurrence\nof the vacancy. In this case the dates are as follows:\n\n\nDate of vacancy:- 20.09.2012\nPolling date:- 04.12.2012\nNumber of days:- 76 days\n\n\nElection  Commission  of  Pakistan  extended  the  polling  date from 17.11.2012 to 04.12.2012 on the basis of   Letter dated\n06.11.2012 issued by the Home Department, Government of the Punjab to the Secretary, Election Commission of Pakistan, Islamabad which states as follows:-\n\n“3.       Law  Enforcement  Agencies  of  Punjab  are  heavily engaged in making foolproof security arrangements for Muharram-ul-Harram.   Pakistan Army and Rangers have also been requisitioned in aid of civil power.  In view of prevailing security situation and threat assessment, it is requested that bye\nelections scheduled on 17th  and 27th  November, 2012 may be postponed until after 15th Muharram (3rd December, 2012).” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above shows that the reason from the extension was an imminent threat of a law and order situation and security of the public at large.  It is for such eventualities that the Constitution provides for relaxation of constitutional timeframe. Article 254 of the Constitution states as under:-\n“254    When any act or thing is required by the constitution to be done within a particular period and it is not done within that period, the doing of the act or thing shall not be invalid or otherwise ineffective by reason only that it was not done within that period.”\n\n\nUnder the above Article, the Constitution mandates that if any act is not done within a particular time, as provided under the Constitution, the said act will not be invalid because of this reason alone. The constitutional relaxation does not extend an unqualified license or in any way dilute the importance of constitutional timelines.   The extension must be grounded in good cause and justified by bona fide reasons. The purpose of Article 254 of the Constitution is not to permit anyone to defeat or frustrate the Constitution, hence it is not available where the constitutional timeframe is not honoured without any justifiable public interest or for oblique political ends or to override the scheme of the Constitution e.g., the minimum period of 46 days as discussed above.  In this particular case, the polling date was extended in the public interest and to avoid the threat of a law and order situation. This gives a lawful justification for extending time. The extension also does not upset the constitutional  minimum  of  46  days  to  represent  the constituency as a Member of the Assembly.  No other reason for the extension of time frame under Article 224(4) of the Constitution has been argued or pleaded before this Court by the petitioners.   Article 254 of the Constitution is, therefore, applicable and comes to the rescue of the ECP. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23.     The argument that holding of Bye-Elections will result in wastage of funds cannot be held over and above the constitutional principle of continuous representation of the people in the Assemblies through their representative.  This is an essential characteristic of a Republic and cannot be compromised.\n\n24.     The  argument  regarding  election  expenses  cannot  be gone into as the petitioner has failed to attach any record or details of election expenses or the estimated future expenses required during the period of extension. Even otherwise, this Court does not delve into question of factual inquiry while exercising its constitutional jurisdiction.\n\n25.   It is also noticed that only one petitioner from the entire constituency has come forward while the private contesting respondents are candidates who are ready and willing to contest the elections. It shows that electors are keen that Bye Elections are held and their constituencies represented in the Assemblies.\n\n26.     For   the   above   reasons,   I   hold   that   the  impugned Notification  dated  08.11.2012  issued  by  the  ECP  does  not offend Article 224(4) of the Constitution.  Hence, this petition has no force and is, therefore, dismissed with no order as to\ncosts.\n\n \n\n\n\nM.

It is the case of the leaned counsel for the petitioner that this Court in FAO No.51/2013 arising from an of the order of Consumer Court vide order dated 09.06.2014 held that District Consumer Court lacked  jurisdiction in view of the Telecom Consumers Protection Regulations, 2009 whereas the case of respondent is that a conflicting judgment has been passed by this Court in F.A.O. No. 60/2009 wherein the complaint before the Consumer Court against the Telecommunication Company was held maintainable.\n\n4.       Arguments heard and record perused.\n\n\n5.       Before dealing with the case in hand, it is pertinent to point out that judgment passed by this Court in FAO No. 51/2013 and F.A.O. No. 60/2009 are not conflicting with each other. In F.A.O. No. 51/2013 it was held that in presence  of  Telecom  Consumers  Protection  Regulations,  2009,  which  is  a federal statute, a provincial statute i.e. Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 is not applicable, whereas, in F.A.O. No.60/2009 a complaint under Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 was filed in year 2006 before the promulgation of Telecom Consumers Protection Regulations, 2009, therefore it was held that Telecom Consumers Protection Regulations, 2009 will become applicable from the date of notification i.e. 06.04.2009 and cannot be applied retrospectively, and it was held that as the complaint filed in the year 2006 under the Punjab Consumer Protection, Act 2005 was maintainable.\n\n6.       In the case at hand, respondent No.2 has filed the complaint admittedly on 11.06.2012 whereby he prayed that action against the petitioner be taken under  the provisions of sections 28,31 & 32 of the Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 as the petitioner company is involved in sub-standard, low quality, faulty, defective services and by charging extra amount and making wrong addition and deduction from the account of the complainant as well as from the other consumers of the petitioner company.\n\n7.       Admittedly petitioner company is a Telecommunication Company which is a federal subject and falls at item No.7 of the Federal Legislative. It is for this reason this Court while dealing with FAO No.51/2009 has held vide order dated 09.06.2014 that Telecom Consumers Protection Regulations, 2009 presently holds the field and in case of any grievance with regard to Telecommunication the same will be dealt with under said Regulation. Regulation No.11 of the Telecom Consumers Protection Regulations, 2009, which states as under:-\n\n\n11.        Nature of  complaints—Notwithstanding anything contained in any procedures provided in any law for the time being in force, all Operators shall entertain complaints of Consumers in relation to any Service, including but not limited to the following issues:\n(i)         Misuse of Service (ii)        Quality of Service (iii)       Illegal Practices\n(iv)       Poor Services\n(v)        Provision of Service (vi)        Misleading Statements (vii)      Non-Provision of Service\n(viii)     Mobile Number Portability related complaints\n\n\n8.       The   contents   of   complaint   filed   before   the   Consumer   Court   by respondent No.2 clearly reveal that the same falls within the parameters mentioned  in  regulation  11  of  Telecom Consumers  Protection  Regulations, 2009. Regulation 15   whereof relates to procedure by which the complaints needed to be dealt with by the authority and also contains the action/powers which can be passed/imposed against the Telecommunication company as mentioned in Regulations No.15 (9) and (10) reproduced hereunder for ready reference:-\n\n(9)        In the event that a complaint filed under sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 15 reveals general deficiency or systemic inadequacy in the provision of Services adopted by the Operator, the Operator shall take remedial steps in respect of all Consumers and intimate the same to the Authority.\n(10)      Without prejudice to the forgoing the Authority may on its own, initiate appropriate action against the Operator, for any activity or activities directly or indirectly, adversely affecting the interests of the Consumers.\n\n9.        It is not denied by any of the parties that Telecommunication Company falls within the ambit of Federal Laws, therefore, any legislation made by the Federal Government will prevail over the provincial statute. Hence, in presence of Telecom Consumers Protection Regulations, 2009, which have been made pursuant to clause (o) of sub-section (2) of Section 5 read with clause (c) and (m) of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organization) Act, 1996, being a special law, the District Consumer Court has no jurisdiction to entertain complaint against the telecommunication company under the Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 being a general law.\n\n10.      Even otherwise it is settled principal of interpretation of statute that provision of special law on a subject exclude the applicability of general law to such subject. Reference in this regard is made to the case reported as Inspector General of Police Punjab Vs Mushtaq Ahmed Warraich (PLD 1985 SC 159).\n\n11.      For the facts and reasons enumerated above, order dated 22.9.2014 is hereby set aside. Consequently, the complaint filed by respondent before the Consumer Court Gujranwala is returned under Order VII Rule 10 CPC to the respondent for filing before the competent forum.\n\n12.

The question of law raised in this reference is as follows and arises out of tax years 2004 to 2008:-\n\n“Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in holding that the Society does not fall in the regime of a “Company” as defined under section 80(2)(b) and not liable to minimum tax u/s 113 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001?”\n \nT. R. No. 01/2011 2\n\n\n\n\n3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that admittedly respondent assessee is a society duly registered on 30.05.1985 under Societies Registration Act, 1860 (“Act”). As a consequence, the respondent assessee falls within the definition of a Company as per Section 80 (2) (b) (v) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001\n\n(“Ordinance”) and is liable to pay minimum tax in terms of Section 113 of the Ordinance.\n\n4. Representative of the respondent assessee submits that the respondent being a society registered under the Act does not fall within the definition of a “Company” because the language of Section 80 (2) (b) (v)1 of the Ordinance requires that the Society should be\n\n“established or constituted by or under any law for the time being in force” and a Society registered under the Act cannot be said to be established or constituted by or under the Act. He with permission, placed reliance on an elaborate judgment of the learned Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (I.T.A. No.1705/KB of 1996-97) reported as 1998 PTD 2017 in support of his contention. He additionally submits that minimum tax under Section 113 of the Ordinance was introduced in the year 2009 and hence, does not apply to the tax years prior to Tax Year 2009.\n\n5. In response to the latter submission, learned counsel for the petitioner alongwith Additional Commissioner, Inland Revenue, Multan submitted that minimum tax has been in force throughout, however, it was only omitted in the year 2008 (just one year) and, therefore, to the extent of Tax Year 2008 minimum tax is not chargeable. \n\n6. We have heard arguments of the parties and gone through the record. Section 80 (2) (b) (v) of the Ordinance as it stood in the relevant years is as follows:- \n\n“80 (2 )(b) (v). A trust, a cooperative society or a finance society or any other society established or constituted by or under any law for the time being in force.”(emphasis supplied)\n \n\n\n1 Prior to Finance Act, 2013\n \nT. R. No. 01/2011 3\n\n\n\n\n7. The above sub-section provides that a society established or constituted by or under any law for the time being in force shall mean a “company” for the purposes of Income Tax Ordinance. It is an admitted position between the parties that respondent assessee is registered under the Act and Certificate of Registration dated 30.05.1985 has been placed on the record by the representative of the respondent assessee as Mark “A”. Section 1 of the Act provides as under:-\n\n“1. Societies formed by memorandum of association and registration: Any seven or more persons associated for any literary, scientific or charitable purpose, or for any such purpose as is described in Section 20 of this Act, may, by subscribing their names to a memorandum of association and filing the same with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, form themselves into a society under this Act.” (emphasis supplied)\n\n\nThe above shows that a Society is “formed” when members subscribe their names to a memorandum of association and file the same with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies. In other words once the above documents are registered with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies a Society is formed. “Formed” means to constitute or to come into existence.2 It also means to set up, establish, found or bring into being.3 Therefore, Society is established and constituted at the time of registration under Section 1 of the Act.\n\n8. Section (80 (2) (b) (v) of the Ordinance provides that a company is a society established or constituted by or under any law for the time being in force. What does “established or constituted by or under the Act” mean? “By and Act” would mean by a provision directly enacted in the statue in question and which is gatherable from its express language or by necessary implication therefrom. The words under the Act “would, in that context, signify what is not directly to be found in the statute itself but is conferred or imposed by virtue of powers enabling this to be done; in other words, by laws\n \n\n\n\n2 Chamber’s 21st Century Dictionary. \n3 Concise Oxford Thesaurus. \n \nT. R. No. 01/2011 4\n\n\n\n\nmade by a subordinate law-making authority which is empowered to do so by the parent Act.4\n\n9. In our context “by the Act” means that the entity is the creation of the statute itself, in other words, the primary legislation itself establishes the entity, the source being the legislature itself. Whereas\n\n“under the Act” means that an entity is formed by complying with the procedure set out under the Act and not directly by the Act. For example, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is a body established and constituted by the Act of the Parliament i.e., The Federal Board of Revenue Act, 2007 whereas Pakistan Revenue Automation (Pvt.) Ltd. (PRAL) is a private company incorporated by the FBR under the provisions of the Companies Ordinance, 1984 and hence is considered to be a body formed, established or constituted under the Act.\n\n10. In the present case, the respondent Society has been duly formed under the Act by complying with the provisions of the Act and by getting registered with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies under Section 1 of the Act. For the above reasons, we cannot come to terms with the reasons adopted in the judgment cited by the learned counsel for the respondent. The judgment assumes that a Society under Societies Registration Act, 1860 is already established through an independent instrument (deed, etc.) and subsequently is merely registered under the Act. Hence, the act of registration plays no role in its formation. As a result, any such Society is neither established nor constituted by or under the Act. The basic flaw in the judgment is that it fails to consider the import of Section 1 of the Act (reproduced above). The above provision unambiguously provides that if seven or more persons subscribe their names to a Memorandum of Association and file the same with the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, a Society is formed under the Act. Therefore, a Society under the Act is actually “formed” under the umbrella of the Act by complying with the procedure provided under Section 1 of the Act and does not have any legal existence prior to it.\n\n4 Dr. Indramani Pyarelal Gupta and others v. W.R. Natu and others (AIR 1963\nSC 274).\n \nT. R. No. 01/2011 5\n\n\n\n\n11. For the above reasons, we hold that respondent Society is established and constituted under the Act and squarely falls within the definition of “Company” under Section 80 (2) (b) (v) of the\n\nOrdinance.\n\n12. Even though not cited by the learned counsel for the parties, we find it important to refer to the judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as Commissioner of Income Tax/Wealth Tax Companies Zone-II, Lahore v. M/s Lahore Cantt. Cooperative Housing Society, Lahore and 7 others (PTCL 2010 89) wherein Cooperative Housing Society registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, 1925 was held not to be “company” under Income Tax Ordinance, 1979. The said case is distinguishable inasmuch as section\n\n5 of the Cooperative Societies Act, 1925 (“Act”) provides that “a society which has as its object the promotion of the economic interest of its members in accordance with co-operative principles or a society established with the object of facilitating the operations of such a society, may be registered under this Act with or without limited liability.” Here the act of registration under the statute, does not establish or constitute a Society as the same stands established prior to registration under any instrument of law. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan held that such a society is not “formed” by or under the Act. The facts of the present case and the legislative framework of Societies Registration Act, 1860 is different, hence, the cited judgment is distinguishable.\n\n13. For the above reasons, the legal position that emerges is that a Society registered under Societies Registration Act, 1860 is a body corporate established and constituted under the Act and, therefore, falls within the definition of a “Company” under Section 80 (2) (b) (v) of the Ordinance. \n\n14. As far as, the minimum tax is concerned. Section 113 of the Ordinance is unambiguous and is applicable on companies, hence, respondent assessee is liable to minimum tax subject to qualification that minimum tax is not chargeable in Tax Year 2008. \n \nT. R. No. 01/2011 6\n\n\n\n\n15. For the above reasons, question of law raised above is answered in the negative. \n\n16. Office shall send a copy of this order under the seal of the Court to the learned Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue as per Section 133 \n\n(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. \n\n\n\n\n\n(Mamoon Rashid Sheikh) (Syed Mansoor Ali Shah)\nJudge Judge\n\nM.

Briefly, the facts giving rise to this appeal are that the appellant is running a registered Firm under the name and style  of M/s. Oversease Trading Corporation. The services of the appellant by virtue of an agreement were hired by the Canteen Store Department(“CSD”)   for packing in correct weight  the grocery  and other items. The appellant for the above said purpose purchased an Electronic Bagging Plant from the respondent. It is worth mentioning  here  that  the  above  said  Plant  was  also \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstalled by the respondent at the appellant''s premises. The said Plant did not work properly and as a result thereof the appellant suffered losses. In these circumstances, the appellant filed a complaint on 6.04.2009 before the learned District Consumer Court, Lahore against the respondent for the recovery of Rs.2,380,000/- on account of refund of the entire amount paid by the appellant to the respondent as cost of machine, extra cost paid for purchase of new machine and economic losses arising from deficiency and loss of use of product, etc sustained by the appellant due to defective   and faulty product of the respondent. Learned District Consumer Court after hearing the preliminary arguments  of  the  appellant  returned  the  complaint  vide order dated 6.4.2009 which reads as under:\n“The respondents entered into an Agreement  dated\n\n20.11.2007 with M/S Overseas Trading Corporation for cleaning  and packing of Grocery and other items for CSD, for which purpose a Packing Machine was purchased by the petitioner. The petitioner is running a registered Firm by the name of M/s Overseas Trading Corporation; as such the Corporation does not fall under the definition of a Consumer, as given in the Punjab Consumer Protection Act 2005. This petition is returned to be filed before a proper forum if so advised.\nFile be consigned after due completion.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling aggrieved by order dated 6.4.2009, the appellant has filed the instant appeal before this Court.\n3.      Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the impugned order is against the provisions of law and facts; and, that the learned District Consumer Court has not properly interpreted Section 2(c) of the Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 and therefore,   fell in error while returning the complaint.\n4.      Notice  was  issued  to  the  respondent    but  despite service   he did not turn up to oppose this appeal and resultantly, he was proceeded against exparte vide order dated 12.7.2010.\n5.      I have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and perused the record appended with this appeal.\n6.      The sole question which requires determination by this court is as to whether a firm falls within the definition of\n“consumer”   as   given   in   Section   2(c)   of   the   Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005.   The definition of a “consumer” reads as under:-\n“Consumer” means a person or entity who-\n\n\ni) buys  or  obtains     on  lease  any product for a consideration and includes   any user of such product but does not  include a person who obtains  any product for resale or for \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nany commercial purpose; or\n\nii) hires      any services      for      a\n consideration and   includes  any\nbeneficiary of such services;\nExplanation:-   For   the   purpose   of   sub-clause(i),\n\n“commercial  purpose” does  not  include    use  by  a consumer of products  bought and used by him only for the purpose of his livelihood as a self-employed person.”\n\n\nThe above definition of the term “consumer” is comprehensive one as it covers not only consumer of products but also consumer of services. In relations to products—“consumer” means:\n1) a person or entity who for a consideration: (i) buys any product, or\n(ii) obtains on lease any product, and\n\n2)      any user of such product\n\n\nThere are two exceptions. The term “consumer” does not include a person or entity who obtains any product: (i) for resale, or (ii) for any commercial purpose which does not include  use by a consumer of products bought  and used by him only for the purpose of his livelihood as a self- employed person. In the above quoted definition of “Consumer”, two words, that is, “person” and “entity” have been used. The word “entity” has been defined  in Section\n2(e) of the Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 which reads as under:- \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Entity” means as organization  that has a legal\n\nidentity apart from its members.\n\n\n\nA firm does not fall within the above referred  definition of “entity” as the members of a firm do not form a collective whole distinct from the individuals composing it. The word “person” has not been defined in the Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005. In such a situation we can invoke Section 2 of the Punjab General Clauses Act, 1956 which clearly says, that; “In this Act, and in all the Punjab Acts unless there is  any thing    repugnant  in the subject   or context, definition  given in the General Clauses Act” would apply. Section 2(47) of the Punjab General Clauses Act,\n1956 defines  a “person” as follows:-\n\n\n(47) “Person” shall include any company or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not”.\n\n\nIn view of above, a firm being a “person” falls within the contemplation  of  definition  of “consumer” as provided in Section 2(c) of the Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 and may competently maintain a complaint against a manufacturer in respect of a product before the District Consumer Court if it satisfies that: (i) there is a transaction of sale or lease; (ii) the sale or lease is of product;(iii)the buying or leasing of product is for consideration; (iv) the obtaining  of product is not for resale purpose; and, (v) the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nobtaining of product is not for commercial purpose which does not  include use by a consumer of product and used by him only for the purpose of his livelihood as a self- employed person. In this regard reference may be made to\nthe  case  of   “ Laxmi   Engi neeri ng   Wor ks   vs.   P. S.   G. \n\n\n I ndustr i al  I nsti tute”  ( AIR 1995 S.C. 1428),  “ Ravi   Kant \n\n\nand others vs. National Consumer Disputes Redressal\n\n\n Commi ssi on    and    other s”    (   AIR   1997   Del.    182),\n\n\n “ Depar tment   of   Enter pri se   Trade   and  Investment  vs.\n\n\nThe Carrill Group Ltd” (2007) NICA 39,  “M FI  Fur ni tur e \n\n\nCentre  Ltd  vs.  Hibbert”   160  JP  178,  “Benincasa  vs.\n\n\nDentalkit”  (1998) All ER (EC) 135.\n\n\n7.      In the above circumstances, this appeal is allowed, order dated 06.04.2009, passed by the learned District Consumer Court, Lahore is set aside and the case is remanded to the learned District Consumer Court, Lahore for a fresh decision in accordance with law.

The said provision of the Constitution lays down as follows:\n“(1) A person shall be disqualified from being elected or chosen as, and from being, a member of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament), if--\n(a)  …\n(b)  …\n(c)  he  ceases  to  be  a  citizen  of  Pakistan  or\nacquires the citizenship of a foreign State”\n\n\n2.            In  the  present  case,  the  respondent admits that he is a national of Canada and holds a passport issued by the Government of Canada. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, he denies that he is a Canadian citizen and consequently does not incur the disqualification under Article 63(1)(c) of the Constitution.\n3.            Based on the admission made by the respondent,  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner has placed before the Court two Canadian Laws: firstly,      the      Canadian      Passport      Order,\n1981(“CPO”) and secondly, the Canadian Citizenship Act, 1985 (“CCA”).   Section 4(2) of the CPO provides that a Canadian Passport can only be issued to a Canadian citizen.   The Schedule to the CCA contains the oath of affirmation of citizenship that must be made by every person admitted as a citizen of Canada.  It is re-produced below:\n“I swear (or affirm) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, Her Heirs and successors, and that I will faithfully observe the laws  of  Canada  and  fulfill  my  duties  as  a Canadian citizen.”\n\n\n4.            The learned counsel for the petitioner refutes the plea that he has a nationality but not citizenship  of  Canada  as  being  pedantic  and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwithout support of Pakistani law apart from being contrary to the express statutory law of the State of Canada.   A Canadian passport can only be issued to a Canadian citizen.   Neither Pakistani law nor Canadian law recognize any notion of a non-citizen of the State being given its nationality.\n5.            The learned counsel for the respondent has been given several opportunities to demonstrate his aforesaid plea with reference to law.   However, he has failed to cite any legal\nmaterial  except  the  judgment  given  in  Umar\n\n\nAhmad Ghumman vs. Govt. of Pakistan and\n\n\nothers (PLD 2002 Lahore 521)  The outcome in\n\n\nthat case is adverse to the petitioner’s stand.  No law   has   been   brought   to   show   that   the respondent holds his Canadian passport without having become a Canadian citizen.\n6.            On the other hand, it has been brought on record by the petitioner that the respondent holds an overseas Pakistani card issued by the Government of Pakistan recording his Canadian address  allowing  him  a  visa  free  entry  into \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPakistan.  It is contended that said card is issued only to expatriate Pakistanis having foreign citizenship who under ordinary circumstances would have to obtain Pakistani visa on their foreign passport for entry into Pakistan.\n7.            The   said   contention   actually   draws\n\n\nstrength from judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme\n\n\nCourt  given  in  C.P No.05  of  2012 titled  Syed\n\n\nMehmood  Akhtar  Naqvi  vs.  Federation  of\n\n\nPakistan through Secretary Law and others\n\n\nannounced on 20.09.2012.    That judgment considers precisely the same question of law that is in issue in the present proceedings, namely, whether a pre-election or post-election disqualification under Article 63(1)(c) of the Constitution automatically disqualifies an elected member of a constitutional legislature.  Upon an interpretation of the said provision and of the declaration on oath made by a candidate on his nomination paper for election to a constitutional legislature, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that a  false  declaration  of  citizenship  made  by  an \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nelected representative on his nomination paper would   disqualify   him  from  being  elected  or chosen as Member of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) or a Provincial Assembly apart from exposing him to criminal proceedings for making a misstatement or concealment of fact regarding the acquisition of citizenship of another State.\n8.            In the present case, both the Canadian oath of affirmation made by the respondent No.1 as well as admission that the said respondent is the holder of a Canadian passport are sufficient factual grounds for concluding that respondent is a citizen of Canada.    Consequently, the disqualification under Article 63(1)(c) of the Constitution is squarely attracted to his case.\n9.          Before concluding the matter, it is appropriate to deal with the two preliminary objections  taken  by  the  learned  D.A.G.  Apart from the prayer for a writ of quo-warranto against the respondent, a number of other prayers concerning the faith of the respondent and the registration of criminal cases by NADRA against \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrespondent as well as preventive action by the Ministry of Interior against him are objected.  His objection has force.  The additional prayers apart from prayer of writ of quo-warranto deal with factual aspects on which the petitioner has no locus-standi.   Infact for that reason at the early stage in this petition the learned counsel for the petitioner on Court’s query withdrew those prayers.\n10.          It is also objected that the provisions of Article 225 of the Constitution create a bar on the jurisdiction  of  this  Court  to  hear  the  present matter.   Article 225 of the Constitution provides as follows:\n“No election to a House or a Provincial Assembly shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such tribunal and in such manner as may be determined by Act of Majlis-e- Shoora (Parliament)”.\n\n\nThat constitutional provision protects the sanctity of the election process and does not bar writ petitions filed under Article 199(1)(b)(ii) of the Constitution after the completion of the election process.   Reference is made to   Farz and  Al i ’s  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncase (PLD 1970 S.C 98).   Also the aforenoted\n\n\njudgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in  Syed\n\n\n Mehmood    Akhtar    Naqvi ’ s    case    (Supra)   is\n\n\nreferred to hold that a pre-election or post- election disqualification under Article 63(1)(c) of the Constitution automatically disqualifies an elected person from holding his office.   This consequence follows without recourse either to an Election Tribunal or to the Speaker of the concerned legislature.  It is well settled that a writ of quo-warranto is competent to enforce a disqualification of the holder of a public office on the  constitutional  premise that  no  public  office can be held by a person who does not satisfy its qualification provided by law.\n11.

Appellant, respondent No.1 and few others, contested the elections for NA-54, Rawalpindi. The appellant being the runner up filed an election petition against respondent No. 1. The Election Tribunal, however, found the petition as not verified in the manner laid down in the C.P.C., as required in terms of section 55(3) of the Representation of People Act, 1976 (ROPA) and dismissed the same under section 63(a) of the ROPA.\n\n2. Learned counsel for the appellant refers to the last page of the election petition as originally filed by the appellant before the Election Commission, to show to us that the same has been duly signed by the appellant under the prayer clause, and also under the verification clause and submits that by so signing the petition the appellant has sufficiently complied with the requirement of verification as prescribed through the relevant provisions of Order VI, Rule 15, Code of Civil Procedure. The learned counsel further submits that the above provision, though essentially requires verification of pleadings on Oath or solemn affirmation, however, it does not require such Oath to be administered by any person. Learned counsel submits that section 139 of the C.P.C. deals with the administration of Oath and specifies the persons/officers who may administer Oath, but such, as can been seen from the said provision itself, has been mandated in respect of affidavits only and not with regard to the pleadings.\n\n3. The contention is wholly misconceived and untenable. It is now well settled that merely affixing signature at the foot of the election petition and/or under its verification clause, without the same being attested/verified by an Oath Commissioner, or some other authorized person, by itself, does not meet the requirement of verification as prescribed by Order VI, Rule 15, C.P.C., and thus renders the petition non-compliant with the provisions of section 55(3) of the ROPA, essentially entailing its dismissal in terms of section 63(a) of the ROPA. The first in the line of judgments in this regard is in the case of Engr. Iqbal Zafar Jhagra and others v. Khalil-ur-Rehman and 4 others (2000 SCMR 250), rendered by seven member Bench of this Court, and authored by the then Chief Justice, Hon''ble Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui, where objection with regard to the maintainability of an election petition in respect of election of the Senate was dealt with as follows:--\n\n ""Subsection (3) of section 36 (ibid) clearly requires that every petition and every Schedule or Annexures shall be signed by the petitioner and verified in the manner laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure for verification of pleadings. The verification of pleadings has been provided under Order, Rule 15, C.P.C. which when read with section 139, C.P.C. clearly shows that the pleadings are to be verified on oath and the oath is to be administered by a person, who is duly authorized in that behalf. It is an admitted position that the petition filed by Syed Iftikhar Hussain Gillani though mentions that it is on oath, the oath was neither verified nor attested by a person authorized to administer oath and as such it could not be said that requirements of section 36 of the Act were complied with. We have considered the reasons given by the learned Tribunal in holding that the petition filed by Syed Iftikhar Hussain Gillani did not comply the provisions of section 36 of the Act and are of the view that these reasons do not suffer from any legal infirmity.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, it may be noted here that section 36 of the Senate (Election) Act, 1975, referred to in the above quoted passage is couched in the same language as are the provisions of section 55 of the ROPA. The above view was reiterated by this Court in the context of section 55 of the ROPA by this Court in the case of Sardarzada Zafar Abbas and others v. Syed Hassan Murtaza and others (PLD 2005 SC 600), as under:--\n\n ""3. The verification on oath of the contents of an election petition, is provided under section 55(3) of the Representation of the People Act of 1976, (hereinafter to be referred to as the Act). It provides that every election petition and every schedule or annexure to petition shall be signed by the appellant and verified in the manner laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The Code contains such provisions under Order VI, rule 15, which requires the verification of pleadings, on oath. Such verification is not to be signed in routine by the deponent but being on oath, it requires to be attested either by the Oath Commissioner or any other authority competent to administer oath. It needs hardly to be emphasized that every oath is to be practically administered.\n\n 4. So far as, the provisions of civil law are concerned, such verifications generally are of directory nature. An omission to do so can be rectified subsequently during trial and even the Court can direct such rectification. While, on the other hand, under election laws such verification on oath is mandatory because of being followed by penal consequences under section 63(a) of the Act that makes it mandatory for the Tribunal to dismiss election petition if the provisions of sections 54 and 55 of the Act have not been complied with. Similar view was taken by this Court in Iqbal Zafar Jhagra''s case (2000 SCMR 250(n), though related to the Senate elections. It is, therefore, settled that the verification on oath of an election petition though mannered in accordance with civil law yet it entails upon penal consequences and hence is mandatory.""\n\nTo the same effect are the judgments in the cases of Malik Umar Aslam v. Sumaira Malik and others (PLD 2007 SC 362) and Zia-ur-Rehman v. Syed Ahmed Hussain and others (2014 SCMR 1015).\n\n4. We are not inclined to agree with the learned counsel that the law laid down in the above noted judgments is a result of incorrect enunciation or exposition of the relevant provisions and that the same need to be re-visited. The judgments being based on sound reasoning and correct appreciation of the law, need no interference.\n\n5. Learned counsel further submits that even in case the memo of the petition as originally submitted by the appellant was found to be lacking in meeting the requirements of section 55(3) of the ROPA, such shortcoming was rectified by the appellant by filing a fresh memo of petition which was duly verified/attested by an Oath Commissioner and such memo replaced the original one, and the same ought to have been entertained instead of dismissing the petition. However, in our view, filing of subsequent memo of petition was of no avail, as admittedly the same was filed after lapse of the time of 45 days prescribed by section 52(2) of the ROPA and thus fresh/amended memo, which was barred by limitation, could not have been entertained, such being violative of the right of dismissal of the petition accrued in favour of the respondent No.1.\n\n6. It is, indeed true that in suitable cases and where the amendment sought is necessary for the purposes of determining the real issue, the bar of limitation may be overlooked, however, the amendment, rather the making up of the lacuna, sought to be allowed cannot be considered to be an amendment necessary for the adjudication of the controversy/allegations pertaining to rigging and corrupt practices in the election process, as were involved in the present case. Furthermore, since the petition suffered with the inherent defect of non-compliance of section 55(3) of the ROPA, consequently resulting in its summary dismissal as prescribed by section 63 of the ROPA, the petitioner cannot be allowed to circumvent the purpose of law in the manner sought by him. Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of Malik Umar Aslam (supra), where amendment sought in the memo of an election petition in similar circumstances was dealt with as follows:-\n\n ""9............This Court in the case of Ghulam Bibi (ibid) observed that the question of limitation can be overlooked, once the Court decides that amendment is necessary for the purpose of determining the real question. Applying this test on the case in hand, even if we were to allow the application for amendment, we have to conclude that as far as the amendment in the verification clause is concerned, it would not essentially determine the real issue i.e. controversy between the parties namely respondent No.1 was not a graduate and as such was not qualified to contest election or she has secured false and fictitious bachelor degree through foul means or she is a loan defaulter, etc. It may be noted that in the case of S.M. Ayub (ibid), which has been heavily relied upon by the learned counsel for appellant, this Court noticed that if defect in the pleadings is of such a nature that same would not be sufficient to non-suit the petitioner, amendment can be allowed, but if defect is of such a nature which if allowed to be cured will change the complexion of the proceedings, then the amendment cannot be allowed, but if defect is of such a nature which if the amendment cannot be allowed. Had the appellant sought amendment in pleadings for determination of real issue, relating to merits of the case, the Court could have considered the request of amendment but verification on oath in absence of administration oath by an authorized person, by no stretch of imagination, is an amendment to determine the real issue between the parties...... Therefore, we are of the opinion that amendment in the verification clause of the petition was not permissible, as the application was submitted much after the period of limitation i.e. 45 days as provided in section 52(2) of the Act 1976 for filing of election Petition. In addition to it, a right in favour of the respondent has been created, as such we are not persuaded to subscribe to the view point of the learned counsel for appellant.\n\nAn order of the Election Tribunal permitting amendment to cure the defect in the verification, sought after expiry of the period of limitation was set aside by this Court in the case of Engr. Zafar Iqbal Jhagra (supra) which view has been reiterated by this Court in the case of Zia-ur-Rehman (supra) in the following words:-\n\n ""13. .........\n\n In the instant case, the application for amendment dated 14th October, 2013 was apparently filed on 23rd October, 2013 well beyond the period of limitation i.e. 45 days for filing of an election petition, as provided by section 52 subsection (2) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976, hence, could not have been allowed by the Election Tribunal through the impugned judgment.\n\n7. In view of the foregoing, we do not find any substance in the submission advanced on behalf of the appellant and there being no lacuna, either factual, or legal, justifying interference with the impugned judgment, dismiss the appeal.\n\nAppeal dismissed.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\nForm No.HCJD/C-121\n\n \n\nORDER SHEET\n\n \n\nIN THE LAHORE HIGH COURT, LAHORE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT\n\n\n\nCase No.        CR No.730 of 2012\n\n \n\nMunir Ahmad Khan                Versus              Burma Shell Oil Company etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS.No. of Order/ Proceeding\n\n\n\nDate of order/\n\n\n\nproceeding\n\n\n\nOrder with signature of Judge and that of parties or counsel where necessary\n\n \n\n23.12.2013   Ch.Imtiaz  Ahmad  Kamboh,  Advocate  for  the petitioner.\n\n\n\nMr.M.Tariq Malik, Advocate for respondent No.1.\n\n \n\nThe petitioner/plaintiff had filed a suit for declaration as well as specific performance of contract dated 29.12.2003 regarding the land measuring  05  Kanals  08  Marlas  before  the  learned  trial  court  on\n\n\n\n16.10.2009. The respondent/defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing the written statements through Mian Muhammad Afzal, aAdvocate, but afterwards the alleged compromise was recorded on 07.4.2010 between the petitioner/plaintiff and the alleged appointed counsel of the respondent/defendant  No.1.  On  the  basis  of  said  compromise,  the learned trial court disposed of the suit vide order dated 09.4.2010.\n\n\n\n2.            The respondent/defendant No.1 assailed the aforesaid order dated 09.4.2010 by filing an application under section 12(2) of CPC. The petitioner/plaintiff contested the said application and the learned trial court after analyzing the divergent pleadings of the parties, framed the following issues:-\n\n\n\na.	Whether in the  light  of  averment  of  written statement i.e. blanket refusal of agreement to sell counsel for the petitioner company   Mian   Muhammad   Afzal   Advocate   was   not authorized  to  make  consenting  written  statement  and  to receive any amount of consideration? OP Parties.\n\n \n\nb.	whether   the   concessional   statement   dated   7.4.2010   by submitting a new agreement Mark-A was not permitted as per Wakalat Nama of the company issued in the name of Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate? OP. Parties.\n\n \n\nc.       Relief.\n\n       \n\n3.            After recording evidence of the parties, the learned trial court accepted the application filed by respondent/defendant No.1 vide order dated 09.12.2011, hence the instant Civil Revision.\n\n\n\n4.            The learned counsel for the petitioner/plaintiff has argued that the impugned order passed by the learned trial court is against facts and circumstances of the case; that the learned trial court has committed illegality and material irregularity while passing the impugned order; that the counsel for respondent/defendant No.1 being the attorney was fully authorized to enter into com0promise on the basis of power of attorney, who had rightly entered into comp0romsie with the petitioner/plaintiff after receiving the amount on behalf of respondent/defendant No.1; that the learned trial court has failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested to it in a proper manner through the impugned order, which is liable to be set aside by allowing the instant revision petition.\n\n \n\n5.            On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent/defendant No.1 has refuted the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner/plaintiff  and  submitted  that  the  alleged  agreement  to  sell dated 29.12.2003, the bone of contention of the suit for specific performance filed by the petitioner-plaintiff, was a forged document having been prepared without the knowledge and consent of the respondent/defendant No.1; that Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate had been appointed as a counsel for appearance in the court to contest the suit, who was not especially authorized by respondent/defendant No.1 to settle the dispute while effecting compromise with the petitioner- plainiff or to make anyIqrarnama and the act of the said counsel was apparently based on fraudulent and without authorization, therefore, the learned trial court has  rightly exercised the jurisdiction vested in it\n\n       \n\nwhile   invoking the provision  under   section  12  (2) CPC  on  valid reasons through the impugned order, which is liable to be maintained while dismissal of the titled revision petition having no merit.\n\n\n\n6.          Arguments heard and record perused.\n\n \n\n7.         The petitioner/plaintiff had filed a suit for specific performance on the basis of alleged agreement to sell dated 29.12.2003 against the respondent/defendant No.1. The said suit was contested by respondent/defendant No.1 as well as respondents No.3 to 14 by filing independent written statements. It is pertinent to note that in para 3 of the preliminary objections, respondent/defendant No.1 categorically asserted   that   the   impugned   agreement   dated   29.12.2003   was   a fraudulent document having been forged and maneuvered by the petitioner-plaintiff as M. H. Shah, the alleged executants/signatory thereof had been retired from their company on 16.12.1996 and thereafter he died on 14.9.2002. Respondents No.3  to 14 also denied the existence of the disputed agreement on the objection as narrated above  as  well  as  other  factual  aspects.  Thereafter,  the     counsel appointed by respondent No.1 made a statement on 07.4.2010 and furnished a compromise deed Exh-R-2 before the learned trial court on the basis whereof the suit was disposed of vide order dated 09.4.2010 in the following manner:-\n\n\n\n“***Hence, suit is disposed of in the light of statements of parties dated 7.4.2010 but for the purpose of registration of suit property in the name of plaintiff parties are directed to approach the concerned registering   authority   who   after   verifying   the   title   documents   of defendants No.1 qua suit property and after taking the requisite stamp duty/transfer fee etc. will do the needful to transfer the suit property in the name of plaintiff. It is also mentioned here that the plaintiff and defendants No.3 to 14 are claiming themselves to be occupants of the suit property, therefore, both these parties are directed to avail alternate remedy in this regard. No order regarding determination of possession of these parties is made here”.\n\n \n\nA perusal of the said order reveals that the learned trial court did not decree the suit rather directed the parties to appear before the Sub-\n\n       \n\nRegistrar for registration of the deed regarding the suit property. The said order dated 9.4.2010 passed by the learned trial court was in no way helpful to the petitioner/plaintiff as to may view it is not executable in the eye of law.\n\n   \n\n8.       The respondent/defendant No.1 came forward by filing an application under section 12(2) CPC on the ground that the aforesaid order  having been based on fraud and misrepresentation was liable to be set aside and the counsel for the respondent-defendant No.1 had acted beyond the authority conferred upon him. In support thereof, the respondent-defendant No.1 produced its authorized agent Iftikhar Ahmad, as AW-1, who stated that although Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate had been appointed as a counsel, but he was not authorized to enter into compromise with the petitioner/plaintiff while delegating any specific authority to him in this respect and he was also not authorized to receive the amount from the petitioner/plaintiff on behalf of respondent/defendant No.1 and he has done all this without the permission and at the back of respondent-defendant No.1. Conversely, the petitioner-plaintiff himself appeared as RW-1 and produced Muhammad Ijaz (RW2) and Intikhab Alam (RW3). The stance of the said RWs that compromise deed (Ex:R2) had been executed in their presence and it was signed by Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate on behalf of the respondent-defendant No.1 is not helpful to the petitioner- plaintiff as their testimony is silent on the issue that the said attorney had  specifically been  authorized  to  effect  compromise on  behalf  of respondent-defendant No.1 and he had acted in letter and spirit of the authority conferred upon him through the power of attorney (Ex:R1). Een otherwise the petitioner-plaintiff also failed to produce Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate to prove the contents of power of attorney\n\n       \n\n(Ex:R1). On the other hand a careful study of the said Vakalatnama- power of attorney (Ex:R1) reveals that the executent/respondent- defendant No.1 had authorized the said Advocate only to receive on his behalf the sums and amounts deposited in his account. So, said clause of the power of attorney appears to have not been strictly construed and it can be safely inferred that Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate had never been authorized to receive amounts from the petitioner/plaintiff unless it was deposited in the account of respondent/defendant No.1. A further perusal of the said power of attorney (Ex:R1) also reveals that no specific authority had been conferred on the counsel/attorney for formation of compromise deed (Ex:R2) and production thereof before the court to settle the dispute in the shape of compromise.\n\n   \n\n9.      It is settled principle of law that power of attorney should always be construed strictly and the power/authority having not been specifically given to any attorney or omitted to flow from the contents of document should not be deemed to have been conferred on the attorney concerned. General terms occurring in such document for the purpose of appointing the attorney should be interpreted with reference to the object for which such power of attorney was executed. So intention and object for which such power of attorney was construed is an important factor. It has been held in PLD 1987 Lahore 392 that under Order XXX rule 2 CPC specific powers to be given to the recognized agent otherwise acts should not be binding. A safe reliance can also be placed on 1987 CLC 813. Moreover, on the authority of the case law declared in PLD 1969 Karachi 123 and 1995 CLC 1572 it is observed that power of attorney confers only those powers, which are specified therein and the agent may neither go beyond nor deviate from the terms of this instrument. The august Supreme Court in the case\n\n       \n\nreported as 1992 SCMR 1488 has held that in case of conflict and ambiguity it should be construed for benefit of the executant whereas in PLD 1985 SC 341 the law was laid down that the courts should be vigilant particularly when allegation by the Principal is of fraud. Moreover, as held in 1991 CLC Notes 67, the duty of the counsel is very sacred and he represents parties in adjudication of their rights.\n\n\n\n10.    For the foregoing discussion,  this court  is left  with  no option except to observe that Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate having not been authorized specifically by respondent/defendant No.1 to settle the dispute in the suit through compromise, the statement made by him before the court and the compromise deed (Exh.R2)  were nothing, but a deviation from the authority actually conferred by respondent/defendant No.1 upon him to contest the suit while executing power  of  attorney  in  his  favour  and  the  order  dated    09.4.2010 impugned  by filing  application  under  section  12(2)  CPC  cannot  be sustained in the eye of law as the act of the attorney amounted to play fraud with the court as well as the client to defeat his rights. As such the said order has rightly been struck off by the learned trial court while exercising powers conferred under section 12(2) CPC through the impugned order, which cannot be interfered with by this court in the revisional jurisdiction as the same is not found to be illegal or tainted with  misreading  or  non-reading  of  the  evidence  on  the  part  of  the learned trial court. Resultantly, this Civil Revision having no force is dismissed.\n\n \n\n(Ch.

HCJDA 38\n\nCase No. W.P.3237 of 2011\n\n\nMUHAMMAD FARRUKH IRFAN KHAN, J.- Through this petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 the petitioners have sought for modification of the judgments and decrees dated 13.4.2011 and 20.9.2011, of the learned Judge Family Court, and Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, respectively, to the extent of their maintenance allowance and its annual enhancement and further prayed for decree of the suit as per their claim by setting aside rest of the impugned judgments.\n\n2.       Brief facts of the case are that the petitioners filed a suit for recovery  of  maintenance,  maternity  expenses   (on  the  birth  of petitioner No.2), dower of Rs.200,000/-, a house, 13 ½ tolas gold and dowry articles worth Rs.3,82,441/-. The suit was contested. Issues were framed whereupon evidence of the parties was recorded. The learned trial Court partially decreed the suit, vide judgment and decree dated 13.04.2011 in the following terms:\n \n“the maintenance allowance of minor plaintiff No.2 is fixed at the rate of Rs.5000/- (rupees five thousand only) per month from  the  date  of  institution  of  this  suit  with  10%  annual increase till further orders whereas the instant suit is hereby dismissed to the extent of recovery of maintenance allowance of plaintiff No.1. The instant suit to the extent of recovery of delivery expenses of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only), gold ornaments, deferred dower of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees two lacs only) and a house is also dismissed. However, the plaintiff No.1 is held entitled to the recovery of dowry articles as per list Ex.D-11.”\n\n3.       Feeling aggrieved, both the parties filed separate appeals. The learned lower Appellate Court dismissed both the appeals, with the modification in the judgment and decree of the trial Court to the effect that petitioner No.1/Mst. Nabeela Shaheen was also held entitled to the recovery of her maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.5,000/- per month. The petitioners being dissatisfied have now invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court by filing the instant writ petition.\n\n4.       Learned   counsel   for  the  petitioners,  Mrs.  Sarkar  Abbas, Advocate, at the very outset submitted that she does not press this petition  to  the  extent  of  claim of  maternity  expenses  incurred  by petitioner No.2 on the birth of petitioner No.1. Regarding rest of the claim the learned counsel  contended that the findings of both the courts  below  are  against  the  law  and  facts  on  the  record;  that judgments and decrees of both the courts below are based on surmises and conjectures; that both the courts have misread the evidence available on the record; that petitioner No.1 had brought strong evidence on the record to prove the contents of the nikahnama according to which an amount of Rs.200,000/-, 10 tolas gold and a house was fixed as dower but the same was misinterpreted by both the courts   below   and   illegally   turned   down   her   prayer;   that   the maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.5000/- per month granted to petitioners is insufficient in this age of inflation. Moreover, petitioner No.2 is school going and also suffers from disease of asthama , as such, extra money is needed to cater for his requirements; that respondent is a UK national and earns a handsome amount and he is bound to maintain the petitioners according to his status and income;\n\n5.       Conversely, it has been argued on behalf of the respondent that that maintenance allowance fixed by the Courts below does not commensurate with his source of income as he is jobless; that the learned lower appellate Court has illegally granted to petitioner No.1 the maintenance allowance which was rightly declined by the learned trial Court; that at the time of ‘nikah’ only Rs.2000/- was fixed as prompt dower and the entries mentioned in column No. 14 of the\n‘nikahnama’ are forged and fabricated and are result of manipulation with the connivance of the concerned Nikah Registrar; that petitioner No.1 was given 10 tolas gold ornaments by respondent at the time of\n‘nikah’ which are still with her; that there is no description of the house given in the ‘nikahnama’; that the dowry list appended with the plaint also contained such articles which were never given at the time of marriage and the receipts thereof produced by the petitioner were maneuvered later on.\n\n6.       Arguments heard. Record perused.\n\n\n7.       Admittedly, the  respondent  is  a  UK  national  ever  since his marriage with petitioner No.1. He has taken inconsistent pleas with regard to his source of income in his written statement and during the arguments addressed by his counsel before this Court. In the written \n\n\nstatement he stated that he has no permanent source of income while it is argued by his learned counsel that he is jobless. But he has not been able to deny that he is getting sufficient subsistence allowance being a UK national. In the circumstances, when there is no evidence that petitioner No.1 has been living apart from her husband without any lawful excuse, she is entitled to get maintenance allowance as prayed for in her suit till the subsistence of marriage. Similarly, petitioner No.2, who is minor son of the respondent is a school going child. He being  a  patient  of  asthma  is  also  required  to  meet  considerable expense on his medication. In these circumstances, his maintenance fixed at the rate of Rs.5000/- per month seems to be insufficient to meet his requirements. This Court is, therefore, inclined to enhance his  rate  of  maintenance  from   Rs.5000/- to  Rs.10000/-  with  10% annual increase.\n\n8.       So far as the question of dower, a house and 10 tolas gold is concerned, the petitioner has produced evidence from which it can safely be inferred that at the time of marriage Rs.200,000/- was fixed as dower, in addition to 10 tolas gold and a house. The respondent’s own witness Zaheer Ahmed while appearing as D.W.2 admitted in his cross-examination admitted that an amount of Rs.200,000/- was fixed as dower. The respondent has failed to adduce any cogent evidence to rebut version of the petitioner. There is no weight in the arguments that   the   entries   in   the   ‘nikahnama’   have   been   interpolated.\n‘Nikahnama’ is a public document which is registered under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 and as such presumption of truth  is  attached  to  it.  According  to  law,  four  copies  of  the ‘nikahnama’  are  prepared,  out  of  which  one  is  kept  by  Nikah Registrar, second  is  sent  to  the concerned  Municipal  Corporation, Municipal Committee or Union Council, third copy is supplied to the bride and the fourth one is given to the bridegroom. The very object behind it is so that each party may verify the entries in the Nikahnama according to the terms of marriage settled between them. The ‘nikah’ between the parties was solemnized on 19.8.2007, the suit was filed on 19.12.2009 and during the period from 19.8.2007 to 19.12.2009 and even thereafter the respondent did not bother to avail his remedy against the alleged interpolation in the ‘nikahnama’. During the course of evidence he has equally failed to bring on any record any thing to prove that the entries in column No.14 were changed. In the case of\n\nMuhammad Aslam v.  Mst. Suraya (PLD 2000 Lahore 355) it has been held that if any party was of the view that Nikah Registrar had interpolated  in  the  entries  of  Nikah  Register,  such  party  could approach   the   Deputy   Commissioner   who   was   the   Controlling Authority and could get the same corrected. In the cited case it has also been held that transaction of dower would become complete on the day of marriage and that endorsement of dower against column in\n‘nikahnama’ was a verification of settlement and arrangement already reached between the parties. And that whenever a woman makes a demand through filing a suit for recovery of dower, the person who contends that the entries in Nikahnama are not correct is bound to rebut these entries through strong evidence otherwise the Courts are bound to give a solemn affirmation to the entries in Nikahnama. Keeping in view the evidence available on the record this Court is of the opinion that both the courts below have wrongly dismissed the suit of   the   petitioner   qua   the   claim   regarding   dower   amount   of Rs.200,000/-, 10 tolas gold and a house. She was entitled to recover the same from the respondent as settled between the parties at the time of ‘nikah’. No doubt description of the house is not mentioned in the\n‘nikahnama’ but this fact is not fatal to the claim of the petitioner. In\n\n\nthe case cited as  Dr. Asma Ali v. Masood Sajjad and others (NLR 2011  Civil  293)  wherein  no  description  of  land  was  given  in ‘nikahnama’ in terms of agricultural land’s khasra numbers or identifying data, Supreme Court directed the trial Court to appoint commission comprising of a member of Revenue hierarchy to determine  the  average  price of  per  kanal  of  agricultural  land  and thereafter wife was held entitled to receive as dower market value of\n100 kanals of agricultural land as determined. Seeking guidance from the cited judgment this Court is inclined to direct the District Officer (Revenue), Rawalpindi to inquire as to which one of the house at the time of marriage was owned by the respondent and what was its value. The market value so evaluated by the Revenue Authorities will be payable by the respondent to the petitioner No.1.\n\n9.       For what has been discussed above, the instant writ petition is accepted in the terms enumerated above.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n (Muhammad Farrukh Irfan Khan)   Judge \n\n\nApproved for Reporting.

The petition was filed against preliminary decree for Khula by Judge Family Court, Rawalpindi though order dated 20.01.2014.\n\n2.       Facts, necessary for deciding this appeal, are that marriage of the appellant with respondent No.1 was solemnized on 25.08.2011. As per entry 13 of Nikah Nama, prompt dower was paid in shape of 5½ tola gold ornaments. Suit was filed, by respondent No.1, for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula, recovery of maintenance and dowry articles. It was asserted, specifically in paragraph No.1 of the plaint, that the dower of 5½ tola gold ornaments were taken back by the appellant to financially help his brother with a promise to purchase new gold ornaments. The appellant,   however,   failed   to   honour   his   commitment.   In   written statement; “restitution of conjugal rights” were claimed. The case was fixed for pre-trial reconciliation on 20.01.2014, statement of respondent No.1 was recorded; she expressed hatred towards the appellant and stated that it was not possible for her to live within the limits prescribed by Almighty Allah and requested for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula. It was noted at bottom of the statement that she was ready to forego her  right of dower. However, while announcing dissolution of marriage  on  the  basis  of  Khula,  the  trial  court  observed  that  the controversy regarding payment of dower in shape of 5½ tola gold ornaments needs determination after recording evidence, therefore, following issue was framed: -\n\n“1.    Whether the defendant is entitled to recover 5 ½ Tola gold ornaments as return of Khulla? OPP” The appellant challenged this order in Writ Petition before this Court, which was dismissed, operative part of the order is reproduced for facility: -\n\n“4.       In the instant case, the object of proviso to section 10(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964 was to provide specific remedy without any undue delay so as to keep the wife in a state where she may be deprived of her right to remarry while she is of marriageable age. The learned  Judge Family Court under the circumstances has rightly passed a decree for dissolution of  marriage  on the basis of  “Khula”,  pending final decision regarding the controversy about the return of dower, to be adjudicated upon at later stage because, otherwise even a frivolous claim of dower amount would become a tool to defeat the very objective for which the remedy is provided in the aforementioned provision of law. Respondent No.1 cannot be compelled to wait for the time till the issue regarding the return of 5½ tolas gold ornaments to the petitioner is finally decided by the learned Judge Family Court because in that case, the abovementioned respondent may cross the age of marriage.”\n\nThis decision is challenged in the instant appeal.\n\n3.       Learned counsel for the appellant submits that under proviso to Section 10(4) of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, it was incumbent  upon  the Judge  Family Court  to  restore  the  Haq  Mehr  to husband before passing decree for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula. Argued; that receipt of Haq Mehr was admitted by respondent No.1  in  her  plaint.  He  explains;  return  of  Haq  Mehr  after  payment changes its character to gift or loan to the husband. Submits; while exercising option of Khula, respondent No.1 has herself foregone right to dower. He concludes that a decree of Khula could not have been passed without restoring the dower to appellant, which in essence is a pre- condition under proviso to the Section 10(4).\n\n4.       Learned counsel for respondent No.1 has  supported the reasons given by learned Judge in Chamber (reproduced above).\n\n5.       Heard, record perused.\n\n6.       Examination  of  the  record  shows  that  return  of  dower  was explicitly asserted in the plaint by respondent No.1 but was denied by the appellant in written statement, therefore, was a fact in controversy. It is correct that respondent No.1 has foregone her right to dower in her statement for Khula, however, this statement is not found  against the assertion by respondent No.1 in her plaint. She has forgone her right to enforce the promise for purchasing new ornaments for her.\n\n7.       To   consider   the   argument   that   restoration   of   dower   is   a precondition for the option of  Khula, it is imperative to  examine the proviso to sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, which is reproduced: -\n\n“Provided that notwithstanding any decision or judgment of any Court or tribunal, the Family Court in a suit for dissolution of marriage, if reconciliation fails, shall pass decree for dissolution of marriage forthwith and also restore the husband the Haq Mehr received by the wife in consideration of marriage at the time of marriage.”    (emphasis supplied)\n\nPlain  reading  of the proviso  shows  that legislature has  envisaged the dissolution of marriage “forthwith” on failure of reconciliation. However, the part relating to restoration of dower comes after the word  and which makes the later part disjunctive. It is incorrect to suggest that restoration of dower (Haq Mehr) is a condition precedent under the proviso. This view has already been examined some learned judges of this Court like in cases    Doctor Akhlaq Ahmad versus Mst. Kishwar Sultana and another (1986 MLD 464 Lahore) and  Farzana Shaheen versus Malik Muhammad Iqbal (1989 MLD 3888 Lahore) holding that payment of Haq Mehr is not a sine qua non for dissolution of marriage on the option of Khula.\n\n8.       We are also not convinced by the argument of learned counsel that on return of dower its character is change to gift or loan. This argument suggests for filing of separate suit for recovery of the amount which is no more a dower. Such interpretation is against the legislative intent behind framing special law of Family Courts Act, 1964. The preamble of this Act reveals  that  the purpose of  legislature  is  “expeditious  settlement  and disposal of disputes relating to marriage and family affairs and matters connected therewith;”. Returning or taking back of dower on any pretext by the husband is the „matter relating to family affairs‟  or at least it is\n„connected therewith‟.\n\nSince the trial court has already framed the issue, whether the defendant is entitled to recover 5½ Tolas gold ornaments as return of Khulla?OPP, therefore, we restrain ourselves from giving any further observation on this point.\n\n9.       No illegality, irregularity or jurisdictional defect is found in the decision by trial court   in   framing the issue regarding dower amount when the return of dower was asserted and denied by the parties.\n\n10.     For the reasons given above, the Intra Court Appeal fails. The appeal stands dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n(Mamoon Rashid Sheikh)                          (Shahid Jamil Khan)\nJudge                                                            Judge\n\n\n\nAPPROVED FOR REPORTING.\n\n‘Javaid’\n"\n', '1989 MLD 3888, 1986 MLD 464 Lahore', 'PLD-2015-Lahore-216.pdf'),

Succinctly    facts    leading    to    this petition are that Faiza Meer respondent No.3 (to be called hereinafter as respondent) was wedded to the petitioner on 29.10.2010 in lieu of dower i.e. gold bangles weighing 8 tolas valued Rs.3,50,000/-. Petitioner is MBBS  doctor  by  profession.  After  few weeks of the marriage he left for Saudi Arabia in connection with his employment. Unfortunately  the  wedlock  could  not prolong and on 09.2.2011 the respondent filed  suit  for  dissolution  of  marriage  and also  claimed  recovery  of  dower, maintenance allowance  and  dowry articles against the petitioner. Suit was resisted by \n\n\n\n\n\nthe  petitioner  through  his  real  brother  Toqeer  Daud  as  special attorney. During the pre-trial reconciliation proceedings on 06.7.2011 before learned Judge Family Court petitioner claimed dissolution of marriage on the basis of ‘Khula’. Special attorney of the petitioner did not contest the plea of ‘khula’ however contended that for grant of\n‘khula’ respondent had  to  return  the  dower. Consequently learned Judge Family Court vide order dated 06.7.2011 dissolved the marriage in terms of section 10(4) of the West Pakistan Family Court Act 1964 however keeping in view the divergent pleadings of the parties framed following issues with regard to remaining controversies between the parties:-\n\n1. Whether  the  plaintiff  is  forcibly  deserted  wife  and  is entitled to decree for recovery of maintenance allowance\n@ and period as prayed for?OPP\n\n2. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree for recovery of dowry articles as prayed for?OPP\n\n3.       Whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree for recovery of\nHaq-Mehr as prayed for?OPP\n\n4. Whether  the  defendant  has  discharged  his  liability  of payment of Haq-Mehr?OPD\n\n5. Whether the suit of the plaintiff is liable to be dismissed in view of preliminary objections raised by the defendant in his written statement and defendant is entitled to get back his gold ornaments, burri and other gold ornaments as narrated in the written statmenet?OPD\n\n6.       Relief.\n\n\nAfter recording the evidence of the parties learned Judge Family Court decreed the respondent’s suit against the petitioner in the following manner:-\n\n(i)      Issue No.1 was decided against the respondent and she was found not entitled to maintenance allowance.\n\n(ii)     Issue  No.2  was  partially  decided  in  favour  of  the respondent  and  she  was  found  entitled  to  recover  the \n\n\n\n\n\ndowry articles excluding the articles mentioned at serial\nNo.1 to 5 and 32 to 35 of the list (Exh.P2).\n\n(iii)    Issue No.3 was decided against the respondent and her claim for recovery of dower was declined.\n\n(iv)    Issues No.4&5 were decided against the petitioner.\n\n\nBoth the parties being dis-satisfied with the judgment and decree dated 03.9.2013 passed by learned Judge Family Court assailed the same through separate appeals. The learned Appellate Court after hearing  the  parties  vide  consolidated  judgment  and  decree  dated\n11.7.2014 dismissed the appeal lodged by the petitioner however appeal lodged by respondent was partly allowed with certain modifications in the following manner:-\n\n(i)      Respondent is entitled to get maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.15000/- per month for “iddat’ period only.\n\n(ii)     Respondent is entitled to recover the dowry articles as per  list  except  Articles  No.1  to  5  &  32  to  35  or  in alternate Rs.3,77,100/- as price of the remaining articles.\n3.                 Learned counsel for the petitioner has vehemently argued that:-\n\n(i)      learned Appellate Court erred in law while granting maintenance allowance with regard to period of ‘Iddat’ in favour of the respondent;\n\n(ii)     that petitioner left for abroad for his employment in the month of November 2010 leaving the respondent behind residing in his house who later on left the petitioner’s house without his permission and also took away the gold ornaments owned by the petitioner; that alternate price of the dowry  articles  were  wrongly  fixed  to  the  tune  of Rs.3,77,100/- by the learned Appellate Court; \n\n\n\n\n\n(iii)    that respondent is bound to return dower i.e. gold bangles weighing 8 tolas valuing Rs.3,50,000/- to the petitioner in consideration   of   ‘Khula’  granted   by  learned   Judge Family Court;\n\n(iv)    that the impugned judgments and decrees of the learned Courts below are based on misreading and non-reading of   evidence,   against   law   and   facts   and   without\napplication of judicious mind;\n\n\n (v) that   learned   Courts   below   wrongly   exercised   the\n  jurisdiction while passing the impugned judgments and\n\n\n\n\n4.  decree which are liable to set aside.\n\n\nArguments heard. Record perused.\n\n5.  \nIt  is  an  established  principle  that  findings  on  fact\nrecorded  by  a  competent  court  in  exercise  of  lawful  jurisdiction cannot be agitated by invoking writ jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 unless the same suffer from perversity causing serious miscarriage of justice.\n\n6.                 As regards recovery of dowry articles it is pertinent to mention that respondent in Paragraph No.3 of her plaint has categorically alleged that dowry articles comprising clothes, furniture, electronic appliances, utensils and gold ornaments etc. detailed in the annexed list were given to her at the time of marriage which are lying in possession of the petitioner. The said list (Exh.P2) is produced in the evidence. Record reveals that petitioner while filing the written statement replied paragraph No.3 of the plaint as under:-\n‘That the paragraph No.3 is not admitted because the plaintiff has taken the ornaments mentioned at serial Nos.1 to 5 and 32 to 35 attached with the plaint, and some items are mentioned in the   list   through   exercising   misrepresentation   and   false version.’\n\nBare reading of the above paragraph transpires that in the written statement petitioner has not mentioned that which articles of \n\n\n\n\n\nthe list were not brought by the respondent at the time of marriage. It is also not contended by the petitioner that he is not in possession of other articles of dowry mentioned in the list. Even petitioner’s brother/special attorney Touqeer Daud (DW-2) in his affidavit (Exh.D2) did not mention that the respondent had not brought the dowry articles mentioned in the list at the time of marriage or the same were not lying in possession of the petitioner. His statement as DW-1 is also silent in this regard. In view of the above findings of the learned Appellate Court on issue No.2 can not be termed as based on misreading or non-reading of evidence available on the record.\n\n7.                 There is no cavil to the proposition that in a suit for dissolution of marriage if reconciliation fails it is bounden duty of the Family Court to pass a decree for dissolution of marriage forthwith in terms of section 10(4) of the Family Court Act 1964 and shall also restore to the husband the Haq Mehr received by the wife in consideration  of  khulla.  It  will  be  expedient  to  reproduce  the provisions of section 10(4) of the Family Court Act 1964 which reads below:-\n\n“Section 10(4):If no compromise or reconciliation is possible the Court shall frame the issues in the case and fix a date for recording of the evidence\nProvided that notwithstanding any decision or judgment of any Court or tribunal, the Family Court in a suit for dissolution of marriage,   if   reconciliation   fails,   shall   pass   decree   for dissolution of marriage forthwith and shall also restore to the husband the Haq Mehr received by the wife in consideration of marriage at the time of marriage.”\n\nThe expression ‘Haq Mehr received by the wife in consideration of marriage at the time of marriage’ used in the above noted provision is very significant. In this case it is not disputed that at the time of marriage between the parties eight bangles of gold were fixed as dower as recorded in column No.13 of the Nikahnama (Exh.P3). Column No.14 of the Nikahnama pertains to the type of\ndower   i.e.  prompt   or  deferred.  It   bears  the   entry                   . \n\n\n\n\n\nPetitioner’s  contention  is  that  eight  gold  bangles  fixed  as  prompt dower  were paid to the respondent  at  the time  of Nikah  whereas respondent’s case is that she did not receive any dower. To resolve this controversy it will be expedient to go though the ocular and documentary evidence produced by the parties on the record. In Nikahnama (Exh.P3) column No.15 bears the heading ‘as to whether any part of the dower was paid at the time of marriage if so to what extent’. This column is left blank. It therefore fails to reflect that the dower fixed at the time of Nikah was paid to the respondent at the time of marriage. Petitioner himself did not appear in the witness box rather on his behalf case was defended by his real brother Toqeer Daud (DW-1) as special attorney who in his affidavit Exh.D2 stated that at the time of marriage eight tolas gold bangles were given to the respondent  as  dower.  This  part  of  his  statement  is  duly  cross- examined by the respondent contending that no dower was paid to her. The other witnesses namely Tanveer Daud (DW-2) and Wasiq Daud (DW-3)  are  also  real  brothers  of  the  petitioner.  Attiq  ur  Rehman (DW-4) and Farooq Azam (DW-5) are not witnesses of the Nikah between the parties. They are also not relatives of the parties. As per contents of the Nikahnama (Exh.P3) Muhammad Shahzad Butt is a witness of Nikah between the parties. Neither the said witness of the Nikah  nor the  Nikah  Registrar  was  produced  by the  petitioner  to substantiate his contention that dower was paid to respondent at the time of marriage. In the attending circumstances petitioner has not been able to prove the payment of dower i.e. eight tolas gold bangles to the respondent at the time of Nikah. Findings of the learned trial Court on issues No.4 and 5 lawfully maintained by learned lower Appellate Court after careful scrutiny of the evidence do not call for any interference by this Court.\n8.                 The learned Appellate Court in the impugned judgment and decree dated 11.7.2014 while deciding issue No.1 has declared that  the  respondent  is  entitled  to  get  maintenance  allowance  @ \n\n\n\n\n\nRs.15000/- per month for ‘Iddat’ period only. Learned counsel for the petitioner has vehemently argued that in this case respondent was not entitled to the maintenance allowance even for the ‘Iddat’ period and that the Appellate Court’s order in this regard is illegal and liable to set aside.\n\n9.                 Proposition in hand deals with the divorced wives’ right for  maintenance  during  the period  of  ‘Iddat’.  A  Muslim divorced woman cannot remarry for three months and in case of death of husband for four months and ten days. This period of probation is called ‘Iddat’. She is entitled to get maintenance allowance for this period  on  account  of  above  condition.  In  case  of  a  divorce  to  a pregnant  woman  the  Holy  Qur’an  in  Verses  No.4  to  6  of  Surah Al-Tallaq entitles her to maintenance till the delivery of child. Surah Al-Tallaq comprises 12 verses. To understand the spirit of the Commands of Allah on the subject it will be expedient to reproduce the English translation of these verses as under:-\n\nEnglish Translation of Surah Al-Tallaq\n\n“1.        O Prophet! (Say Unto the Muslims) When ye put away women, put them away for their (legal) period and reckon the period, and keep your duty to Allah, your Lord. Expel them not from their houses nor let them go forth unless they commit open immorality. And these are the limits imposed by Allah; and whose transgresseth Allah’s limits, he verily wrongeth his soul. Thou knowest not: it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.\n2.          Then, when they have reached their term, take them back in kindness or part from them in kindness, and call to witness two just men among you, and keep your testimony upright for Allah. Whoso believeth in Allah and the Last Day is exhorted to act thus. And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, Allah will appoint a way out for him-\n3.          And will provide for him from (a quarter) whence he hath no expectation. And whosoever Putteth his trust in Allah, He will suffice him. Lo! Allah bringeth His command to pass. Allah hath set a measure for all things.\n4.          And   for   such   of   your   women   as   despair   of menstruation, if ye doubt, their period (of waiting) shall be three months, along with those who have it not. And for those with  child,  their  period  shall  be  till  they  bring  forth  their \n\n\n\n\n\nburden. And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, He maketh his course easy for him.\n5.          That is the commandment of Allah which He revealeth unto you. And whoso keepeth his duty to Allah, He will remit from him his evil deeds and magnify reward for him.\n6.          Lodge them where ye dwell, according to your wealth, and harass them not so as to straiten life for them. And if they are with child, then spend for them till they bring forth their burden. Then, if they give suck for you, give them their due payment and consult together in kindness; but if ye make difficulties for one another, then let some other woman give suck for him (the father of the child).\n7.          Let him who hath abundance spend of his abundance, and he whose provision is measured, let him spend of that which Allah hath given him. Allah does not lay on any soul a burden save that which He hath given it. Allah will vouchsafe, after hardship, ease.\n8.          And  how  many  a  community  revolted  against  the ordinance of its Lord and His messengers, and We called it to a stern account and punished it with dire punishment.\n9.          So that it tasted the ill-effects of its conduct, and the consequence of its conduct was loss.\n10.        Allah  hath  prepared  for  them  stern  punishment;  so keep your duty to Allah, O men of understanding! O ye who believe! Now Allah hath sent down unto you a reminder-\n11.        A Messenger reciting unto you the Revelations of Allah made plain, that He may bring forth those who believe and do good works from darkness unto light. And whosoever believeth in Allah and doeth right, He will bring him into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein to abide for ever. Allah hath made good provision for him.\n12.        Allah it is Who hath created seven heavens, and of the earth the like thereof. The commandment cometh down among them slowly, that ye may know that Allah is Able to do all things, and that Allah surroundeth all things in knowledge.”\n\n\n10.               Reference to the proposition three other verses of  the\nHoly Qur’an are also relevant. English translation of these verses read below:-\n\nVerse No.236 of Surah Al-Baqrah\n\n“236.    It is no sin for you if ye divorce women while yet ye have not touched them, nor appointed unto them a portion. Provide for them, the rich according to his means, and the straitened according to his means, a fair provision. (This is) a bounden duty for those who do good.”\n\nVerse No.241 of Surah Al-Baqrah\n\n“241. And for divorced women is a provision in kindness. A\nduty for those who ward off (evil).” \n\n\n\n\n\nVerse No.49 of Surah Al-Ahzab\n\n“49. O ye who believe! If ye wed believing women and divorce them before ye have touched them, then there is no period that ye should reckon. But content them and release them handsomely.”\n\n11.               In  the above quoted three verses husbands  have been directed to give ‘Mata’ to their divorced wives. In verse No.6 of Surah Al-Tallaq a husband has been directed to give ‘Nafaqah’ to a pregnant divorced wife. The Arabic words ‘Nafaqah’ and ‘Mata’ used in the Holy   Qur’an   are   ordinarily   translated   as   ‘maintenance’   and\n‘provision’  respectively  by  various  English  Translators  and Interpreters of the Holy Qur’an. Some of the Arabic Scholars expressing their dis-satisfaction over the English translations have opined that these are poor translations. Needless to say that rendering the  depth  and  shades  of  meaning  of  words  of  one  language  into another language and finding the equivalent is a difficult task. So many English translators have confessed that the Holy Qur’an is not translatable because of this and perhaps for this reason they have titled their translations as interpretations. In various Arabic lexicons the word ‘Mata’  means ‘temporary gain’  or ‘benefit’.  The  Qamus-al- Quran al Wajuh An-Nazair published in Beirut gives the meaning of the word ‘Mata’ as ‘Munafah or profit or gain’. Imam Raghib Asgahani in his lexicon namely Mufradat defines the word ‘Mata’ as\n‘something given to a divorced woman from which she can derive benefit’. According to it the word ‘Nafaqah’ means living expenses. The lexicon Tartibul Qamus published in Egypt says that ‘Mata’ is a kind of maintenance given to a woman. Al-Qamus-ul Asri (Modern Dictionary from Arabic to English) defines the word ‘Nafaqah’ as expenses on living and the word ‘Mata’ as ‘effects’ or ‘goods’. Imam Razi writes in Tafsir Kabir that ‘Mata’ covers only articles of temporary benefit given as a parting or a consolation gift.  The author of Lisan ul Arab opined that ‘Mata’ is only a one time gift and not like maintenance which is payable over a period of time. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n12.

In verse No.241 of Surah Al-Baqrah the word ‘Mata’ is qualified by the word             (bil maroof) which means ‘well known’ or ‘customary’.

This is a duty on the righteous.’ Last part of verse No.241 manifests that the above said command is for those who fear Allah. In various   Ahadith   it   is   reported   that   the   Holy   Prophet   Hazrat Muhammad (Peace be upon him) said that ‘Mata’ should be given even by those in straightened circumstances and it may be a few kilograms dates, some clothes or grain if they cannot give any thing better.\n\n14.               The ordains of Almighty Allah as revealed in the Holy Qur’an and practised by the Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (Peace be upon him) manifest complete code of life to enable us to order our lives in the individual and collective spheres in accordance with the \nteachings of Islam. The words\n \n(Fa mate o hunna) (to provide)’ \n \nand\n \n(fa anfiqo) (to spend)’ used in above referred verses of the \n\nHoly Qur’an reveal the commands of Allah to a Muslim husband rendering him under obligation to maintain his divorced wife during the period of ‘Iddat’ as per injunctions of Islam. It may be a one time provision  or  in  shape  of  affordable installments  for the  period  of ‘Iddat’.  Needless  to  say  that  intent  and  spirit  of  above  referred Commands of Allah is to provide for maintenance to a divorced wife  du rin g   th e   period   o f    ‘Iddat’  for  the  simple  reason  that   as   per injunctions of Islam a divorced woman cannot remarry  during the period of ‘Iddat’. Above noted Commands of Allah therefore create a right of maintenance in favour of a divorced wife  and an obligation upon a husband to maintain her during the period  of ‘Iddat’. In our country such right of maintenance is enforceable by a Family Court having  exclusive  jurisdiction  under  Family   Court  Act  1964.  I therefore do not find any legal infirmity or jurisdictional error in the findings  of  the  learned  Appellate  Court  declaring  the  respondent entitled to get maintenance allowance for ‘Iddat’ period.\n\n15.               For the above reasons, this constitutional petition having no merit is dismissed in limine.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nApproved for Reporting.\n \n(ABDUS SATTAR ASGHAR) JUDGE \n\n\n \n\n\n ‘E ja z’ \n \nJUDGE\n"\n', NULL, 'PLD-2015-Lahore-258.pdf');
