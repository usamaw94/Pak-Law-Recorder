Brief facts of the case are that Muhammad Asif Ali respondent in FAO No.17/2009, Ali Ahmed respondent in FAO No.18/2009, and Zulfiqar Ali, and Mohammad Irfan respondents in FAO No.19/2009 moved three separate  applications  in  the  District  Consumer  Court,  Bahawalpur  on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11.02.2009  with  assertion  that  they had  purchased  plots  on  installments spreading over four years and had been depositing installments with receipt regularly and are not defaulter. They stopped the installments when they received the receipts of the installments without signatures of the owner. They stated that the owner is not ready to transfer the land in their favour and that their grievance may be redressed by directing the owner to transfer\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\nthe land  in  their  favour.  Muhammad  Ameer  Qazi  appellant  in  all  three matters made entrance in the said court and was directed to submit written reply to the applications of the respondents. On 10.04.2009 following order was passed by the Court below in three applications separately which is reproduced as under:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n3.

He further contended that as both the parties themselves made statements regarding compromise in the Court  so  District  Consumer  Court  has  committed  no  illegality  while recording compromise statements of the parties and disposal of the matter and lastly contended that all the three appeals may be dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.          I  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  and  have perused the record.\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n7.        The preamble to the Punjab Consumer Protection Act (PCPA\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nstates:-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPREAMBLE:-   Whereas,   it   is   expedient   to   provide   for protection and   promotion of the rights and interests of the consumers, speedy redress of consumer complaints and for matters connected therewith.‘ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n8.        Consumer is  defined in Section 2-C of the Consumer Protection\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAct, 2005 as under:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2 (C ) ”†Consumer‘†means a person or entity who◊ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n(i)          buys or obtains on lease any product for a consideration and  includes  any  user  of  such  product  but  does  not include a person who obtains any product for re-sale or for any commercial purpose; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(ii)          hires any services for a consideration and includes any beneficiary of such services;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor the purpose of Sub-clause\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(i) ‘£ommercial purpose‘†does not include use by a consumer of products bought and used by him only for the purpose of his livelihood as a self-employed person.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nServices are defined in 2-K of PCPA Act 2005 is as under:- ‘ìervices‘†includes the provision of any kind of facilities or  advice  or  assistance  such  as  provision  of  medical, legal or engineering services but does not include--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(i)      the rendering of any service under a contract of personal service;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(ii)     the  rendering  of  non-professional  services  like astrology or palmistry; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(iii)    a  service,  the  essence  of  which  is  to  deliver judgment by a court of law or arbitrator;\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nSection 13 of the PCPA 2005 is as under:-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLiability for faulty or defective services.-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA provider of services shall be liable to a consumer for damages proximately caused by the provision of services that have caused damage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 28 of PCPA Act 2005, is as under:-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n(1) ”†A consumer who has suffered damage, or Authority\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n`in other cases, shall,  by written notice, call upon a manufacturer or provider of services that a product or service is defective or faulty, or the conduct of the manufacturer or service provider is in contravention of the provisions of this Act and he should remedy the defects  or give damages  where   the consumer has suffered   damage,   or   cease   to   contravene   the provisions of this Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) The  manufacturer  or  service  provider  shall,  within fifteen days of the receipt of the notice, reply thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) No claim shall be entertained by a Consumer Court unless the consumer or the Authority has given notice under sub-section (1) and provides proof that the notice was duly delivered but the manufacturer or service provider has not responded thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) A claim by the consumer or the Authority shall be filed within thirty days of the arising of the cause of action:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProvided that the Consumer Court, having jurisdiction to hear the claim, may allow a claim to be filed after thirty days within such time as it may allow if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing the complaint within the specified period:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProvided further that such extension shall not be allowed beyond a period of sixty days from the expiry of the warranty or guarantee period specified by the\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nmanufacturer or service provider and if no period is specified one year from the date of purchase of the products or providing of services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 31 of PCPA Act 2005, is as under.-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nORDER OF CONSUMER COURT\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf, after the proceedings conducted under this Act, the Consumer Court is satisfied that the products complained against suffer from any of the defects specified in the claim or that any or all of the allegations contained in the claim about the services provided are true, it shall issue an order to the defendant directing him to take one or more of the following actions, namely:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(a)     to remove defect from the products in question;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(b)     to  replace  the  products  with  new  products  or similar description which shall be free from any defect;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(c)	to return to the claimant the price or, as the case may be, the charges paid by the claimant;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(d)     to do such other things as may be necessary for adequate and proper compliance with the requirements of this Act;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(e)	to pay reasonable compensation to the consumer for any loss suffered by him due to the negligence of the defendant;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(f)      to award damages where appropriate;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(g)     to  award  actual  costs  including  lawyer”≥  fees\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nincurred on the legal proceedings;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(h)     to recall the product from trade or commerce; (i)      to confiscate or destroy the defective product;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(j)      to  remedy the defect  in such period  as may be deemed fit; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(k)     to cease to provide the defective or faulty service until it achieves the required standard.\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n8.       The contents of the application of each respondent is as under:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  \r\n\r\n9.         Perusal of the above provisions shows that in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the Consumer Court, the complainant must first qualify to be ‘Éonsumer‘Æ To be a Consumer under the said Act, a person must hire the ‘ìervices‘†for a certain consideration from the services provider. In case there is no Services being availed by the complainant and no consideration being paid in return for the said services, the complainant does not qualify to be a Consumer and, therefore, the matter goes outside the fold of said Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.     According to the contents of all the three applications all the applicants alleged that there was an agreement regarding the purchase of plots but present appellant has refused to execute the register sale deed in their favour. This matter relates to the breach of contract and\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\ncivil court has the jurisdiction and absolutely Consumer   Court had not the jurisdiction who had wrongly entertained such an applications for execution of the agreement to sell regarding immoveable property and decided the same illegally without jurisdiction. As dispute regarding immoveable property cannot be converted as consumer dispute since there is no sale of goods or services for consideration. The arguments of the learned counsel for the respondents that both the parties with their consent decided the matter from District Consumer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt is not tenable as it is held in case titled ‘Ådministrator, Thal\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDevelopment  through  EACO  Bhakkar  and  others     vs.  Ali\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMuhammad‘† (2012 SCMR 730) as under:-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nConsent of the parties can neither confer nor can take away the jurisdiction of a Court/Tribunal, unless so conferred or barred by law.‘ç\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJurisdiction of the Consumer Court is different from the civil jurisdiction. Consumer Court is to identify a consumer a building service and then if the service is defective, the Consumer Court is to fix damages and award the same as stated above.  Needless to mention here that it is the  duty of every court to examine the issue of bar of its jurisdiction at the earliest opportunity and decide it in accordance with law, instead of escaping to decide such important aspect of the case on mere concession of one or the other party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11.       In view of what has been discussed, these three appeals are allowed  and  order  dated  10.04.2009  passed  by  District  Consumer\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nCourt Bahawalpur, is set aside by dismissing all three applications of the respondents.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Sadaqat Ali Khan) Judge\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nApproved for reporting.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nRamzan*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'PLD 1984 SC (AJ&K) 104, PLD 1984 SC (AJ&K) 104, PLD 1984 SC (AJ&K) 104, 2004 YLR 3121'),

This  petition  under  Article\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, arises out of a suit for recovery of maintenance allowance which was dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge, Shakargarh vide judgment and decree dated 31.10.2008.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.           Petitioner”≥ suit for recovery of maintenance allowance was decreed by the learned Judge Family Court, Shakargarh vide judgment dated 02.04.2008 and the minor/petitioner was found entitled for maintenance allowance @ Rs.800/- per month with 5% prospective annual increase from the date of institution of suit till she is married. It was also held that though petitioner is not the real daughter of respondent No.1, still he was bound by his agreement of adoption. On appeal, learned Additional District Judge, Shakargarh dismissed petitioner”≥ suit primarily on the grounds that since petitioner was not real daughter of respondent No.1 and that Islam does not recognize the concept of adoption. Hence, this petition.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n3.            Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that undisputedly respondent No.1 had given solemn pledge that he will maintain and bring up petitioner as his daughter and by his willful and free act got the petitioner recorded as his own daughter cannot wriggle out of his commitment. Further submits that under the Islamic law paternity is established   by   single   pronouncement   if   the   minor   is   Laqeet (_                  ) and whoever picks up is bound to maintain if he has not given the child to state. Also submit the learned Additional District Judge, Shakargarh have ignored the Islamic law as well as legal dimensions of volunteer pledge made by the petitioner at the time of adoption and taking the child into his parental custody.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.           Although  on  behalf  of  the  respondent  Mr.  Muhammad Ashraf Jilal”≥ name is appearing in the cause list but despite repeated calls non entered appearance on behalf of the respondent No.1 therefore he was proceeded ex-parte.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5.           I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and have gone through record with his able assistance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6.           The first issue that needs to be considered in this writ petition is  with  regard  to  the  laches.  Impugned  judgment  and  decree  was passed by the learned appellate court on 31.10.2008, whereas present writ petition was filed on 04.03.2010 after a period of more than 16 months. Therefore laches should come into play and the writ petition could be dismissed on this ground alone. However, I am not inclined\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nto do so  merely on  this technical  ground, for the reason that the question of laches cannot be considered without considering the claim of each party in the writ petition. While considering the claims of the petitioner, I feel that a significant law point involved herein also attracts the question of public importance, therefore, dismissal on technical grounds becomes insignificant and immaterial. In this regard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreference is made to the law laid down in  Pakistan Post Office Vs.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSettlement Commissioner & others (1987 P.S.C. 796) wherein it\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nwas held that a writ petition could not be dismissed on ground of laches without examining the dictates of justice in the claim of each party apart from examination of law and jurisdictional points involved in the case. The above judgment was also followed by this court in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMuhammad Ismail Vs. Deputy Settlement Commissioner etc (NLR\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1992 UC 725).\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n7.            From the facts of the case in hand the moot point which requires  consideration  by  this  court  is  “∑hether  an  adopted  child would be entitled for maintenance allowance from the adoptive father“ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n8.           Before considering the law I would like to highlight some admitted facts of this case. Petitioner was adopted by respondent No.1 and his wife while the petitioner was of very tender age (about one and half month) and the adoptive parents brought up adopted child as their own daughter and also acknowledged and presented her before public at large as their own daughter. So it is neither disputed nor\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\ndoubted that petitioner was the adopted daughter of the respondent\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNo.1.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n9.             With regard to the concept of adoption in Islam, we can seek guidance from Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). At the time of prophet”≥ marriage (PBUH) with Hazrat Khadijah (RA), she gave  a  slave  namely  Zayd  Bin  Haritha  to  Prophet  Muhammad (PBUH) and the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) took good care of him and their relationship changed from that of master and a slave into one of father and son. Zayd was one of the first persons to have accepted Islam. When his father and uncles came to know about his whereabouts, they came to Mukkah and told Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) that Zayd had been captured by some thieves and sold into slavery. The Prophet set him free, but Zayd refused to leave prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and go home with his father. Haritha the father of Zayd, became very angry and openly declared that from now on ‘öayd  is  not  my  son‘Æ  The  Prophet  immediately  responded  by adopting Zayd. Zayd came to be known as Zayd Bin Muhammad.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n10.             This continued till after the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) migrated to Medina. Zayd had grown up and was now a married man. However, his marriage did not work out. Allah revealed some verses related to Zayd”≥ divorce in which Almighty also talks about the issue of ‘≤e-naming‘†the adopted children. The Almighty says:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnd Allah did not make your adopted children your sons. That is only your words coming out from your\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\ntongues. And Allah says the truth and He guides you to the right path. Call them with reference to their (real) fathers. It is more just in the sight of Allah‘Æ\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(33:4)\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter the revelation of this verse, Zayd was again called Zayd Bin Haritha and not Zayd Bin Muhammad. However, this change in name did not affect the relationship of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and Zayd. They were still like father and son.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n11.        What  this  mean  is  that  adoption  does  not  change  the relationship of a person with his real parents and siblings, nor does it create a real relationship between him and his adoptive parents and their children. The practical implications of this view on the one hand is that all the rules which apply between blood relatives are still valid; for example the child will still be mahram; that an adopted child cannot marry his/her real siblings; he or she is also eligible for inheritance  from  the  real  parents;  and  there  is  no  need  for  hijab between the child and his or her real family. On the other hand, the rules that apply between non-related persons are still valid. For example, adoption would not create the mahramiyyat between the child and the new family. In Islam, the right of inheritance is based on uterine relationship.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n12.          However, there is only one case of adoption where a sort of semi-familial relationship and mahramiyyat is created between the adopted child and the adoptive family:  when the adopted child is below two years of age and is also breast-fed directly by the adoptive\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nmother  for  at  least a  day and  a night. This  creates  a foster  rizai relationship, and the child is mahram to the new family- there is no need  for  hijab,  nor  can  the  child  marry  the  real  children  of  the adoptive parents. However, in case of inheritance, even a rizai child has no right in the estate of the adoptive parents. But as mentioned above, the adoptive parents can write up to one-third of their estate for their adopted child.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n13.          In the case at hand, there is no evidence on record whether the minor was breast-fed by the wife of respondent # 1 or not. However, evidently both respondent # 1 and his wife did not have any other siblings of their own, therefore, it can be safely presumed that minor had no rizai relationship.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n14.     From the above resume of discussion, the analogy emerges as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(i) Adoption is allowed in Islam.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(ii) However, changing the family name of the adopted child is not allowed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(iii) If the child was two years old or less and was also breast fed directly by the adoptive mother for at least a day and a night (or fifteen times consequently), then the child will become mahram to the new family.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(iv) If the child was not breast fed as mentioned above. Then he or she will remain non-mahram to the new family.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(v) Adoption in rizai or non rizai form does not give the adopted child a right to inherit the estate of the adoptive parents; nor does it deprive him or her from  inheriting  the  estate  of  the  real  parents.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nHowever, the adoptive parents have the option of writing up to one-third of their estate for their adopted child.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKeeping in view the above position of adoption in Islam, one can state that  petitioner cannot  claim any  maintenance from the  respondent No.1. There is nothing on record to show that the minor is a rizai daughter of the Respondent No.1 under which petitioner may have a right to claim maintenance from the adoptive father. However, there is another angle of the matter which entitles the petitioner to claim maintenance allowance from respondent No.1.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n15.     Islam  not  only  commands  for  magnanimity  and  clemency amongst weaker segments of society, but also categorically ordains to help poor, needy and more particularly orphans. In all forms of charities, destitute orphans and poor can be categorized to be  the prime eligible recipients for special care and affection. In case of the rights of the orphan children, Allah is very severe; for example Almighty says:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n‘îhose who swallow the property of the orphans unjustly, are actually devouring fire into their bellies and they shall enter the burning fire‘ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIslam fully supports the concept of helping the orphan and poor regardless of their gender, color, caste and creed. If there is none to take care of orphans and poor children, then this becomes the onerous responsibility of an Islamic State.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n16.          If the adoptive parents voluntarily undertake before public at large to perform the noble task of taking care of the minor (s) as a\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nmatter of fact by doing so they not only create relationship of trust with the minor (s) but also assume the role and status of “£onstructive guardian“†of the minor. This trust and constructive guardianship also creates fiduciary obligation/relation between the adopted parents and the minor. In Equity, Trusts and Specific Relief, 5th  Edition, B M Gandhi states that ‘Å fiduciary is a person in a position of trust, or occupying  a  position  of  power  and  confidence  with  respect  to another such that he is obliged by various rules of law to act solely in the interest of the other, whose rights he has to protect≈î\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSimilarly in  case  titled  The Bell  Group  Ltd  (in  liq)  Vs.  Westpac\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBanking Corporation (No.9) (2009) 70 ACSR1, Owen J while dealing\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nwith the fiduciary obligations states;\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n‘ân my view the state of the law is this. Where a person has undertaken to act in the interests of another and where the nature of that relationship, its surrounding circumstances and the obligations attaching to it so required, it will be held to be fiduciary. But the fact that it is categorized as fiduciary does not mean that all of the obligations arising from it are themselves fiduciary. Unless there are some special circumstances in the relationship, the duties that equity demands from the fiduciary will be limited to what I have described as the core obligations: not to obtain any  unauthorized  benefit  from  the  relationship and not to be in a position of conflict. They stem from the fundamental obligation of loyalty‘Æ\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n17.        From the above quoted excerpt it can be easily decipherable that essence of fiduciary obligation is that the fiduciary is precluded from acting in any other way than in the interests of the person to\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nwhom the duty to so act is owed. In short, the fiduciary obligation is one of undivided loyalty.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n18.        The doctrine of constructive guardian has long been a part of the law of guardian and ward and has been rejected by only two cases. The situation arises where one assumes to act as a guardian or enters upon an infant”≥ estate, who has not been regularly appointed a guardian. It may result from a voluntary assumption of the duties, a void appointment by a court without jurisdiction, or acts performed by one who was by himself and other parties concerned, considered an ‘°ccommodation guardian‘Æ Recognition of the need for protection of the infant resulted in giving the infant an election to treat such a person as a wrongdoer or as a guardian. In later case a relation similar to that of trustee and cestui que trust is established and the guardian de son tort may be compelled to account as a guardian.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n19.         Adverting  to  the  facts  of  the  lis  at  hand,  petitioner  was admittedly  adopted  by  respondent  No.1  and  remained  with  the adopted parents for a considerable period. In his evidence, respondent No.1 has admitted that minor was adoptive and was presented as his daughter before the public at large. For all intents and purposes these acts of the respondent No.1 have created  relationship of trust and constructive guardianship between the respondent No.1 and the minor. This relationship also implies the duties/fiduciary obligations to be performed by the respondent No.1 which inevitably include the maintenance of the minor.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n20.         The  doctrine  of  Al-Luqata  relied  upon  by  the  petitioner counsel  relates  to  the  lost  and  found  articles  and  therefore,  not relevant to the facts of the case. The minor child was never ‘¶ound‘†by the respondent No.1 and his wife rather was admittedly adopted by them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n21.           In view of what has been discussed above, this petition is allowed   and   impugned   appellate   judgment   and   decree   dated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31.10.2008 is hereby set aside with the consequence that judgment and decree of the learned Family Court dated 2.4.2008 is upheld and restored.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n22.

It also assails the judgment dated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25.6.2014 passed by learned District Judge Sialkot whereby petitioners“†appeal against above said order was dismissed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.       Arguments heard. Record perused.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n3.       Perusal   of   record   transpires   that Sh.Khalid Mahmood petitioners lodged a suit for declaration along with permanent and mandatory injunction as consequential relief against the respondents on 08.5.2010. The respondents  resisted the said  suit by filing contesting written statement. In view of the divergent  pleadings  of  the  parties  learned trial Court framed the issued on 31.10.2011.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nThereafter  as  many  as  ten  adjournments  were  provided  to  the petitioners for producing evidence. Out of the said ten adjournments on four occasions hearing was adjourned due to strike of the lawyers and  leave  of  learned  Presiding  Officer.  Six  adjournments  were obtained by the petitioners for non-producing the evidence. Lastly on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25.6.2013 learned trial Court granted adjournment to the petitioners on their request in the following manner:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n‘îhe evidence of the plaintiffs is not present. Request for adjournment has been made. Already many opportunities were granted but the plaintiffs failed to produce their evidence. However, in the interest of justice, absolute last opportunity is granted with costs of Rs.500/-. Adjourned for evidence of plaintiff for 16.09.2013.‘ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.                 Even on the fixed date i.e. 16.9.2013 petitioners again failed  to  produce  the  evidence.  Consequently  learned  trial  Court passed the impugned order in the following manner:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n”±6.09.2013\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.10 p.m:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresent:          Ld: counsel for the parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence is not present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is pertinent to mention that the issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere framed on 31.10.2011 whereas despite availing numerous opportunities with costs, the plaintiffs failed to examine even a single witness. On 25.06.2013, the plaintiffs  were granted absolutely last  opportunity with costs of Rs.500. Today i.e. 16.09.2013, the plaintiffs were given opportunity till closing hours to produce their evidence  but  in  vain  which  shows  that  they  have  no interest   to   pursue  the  matter.   Further   adjournment without any cause, would defeat the very object of justice rather tantamount to put the defendants in mental agony. I therefore, by invoking provision of Order XVII Rule 03 of CPC struck off the right of evidence for production of evidence.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVide separate detailed judgment in English of even date; the instant suit is dismissed  for want of evidence. Decree sheet be drawn up. Parties shall bear their own costs. Be consigned to the record room after its due completion.‘ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5.                 Scrutiny of record transpires that despite availing as many as six opportunities the petitioners have miserably failed to produce evidence. In the case of  Maulvi Abdul Aziz Khan v. Mst. Shah Jahan\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nBegum and 2 others (PLD 1971 SC 434) the provisions of Order 17\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure 1908 came under consideration before the Hon”¢le Supreme Court of Pakistan and following principle was enunciated:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘ât will be seen that this rule applies to a case where time has been granted to a party at his instance to produce evidence or to cause the attendance of witnesses or to perform any other act necessary for the progress of the suit and will not apply unless default has been committed by such party in doing the act for which the time was granted.‘ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6.                 In this case Sh.Khalid Mehmood petitioner No.1 while agitating against judgment and decree dated 16.9.2013 in his grounds of appeal before the learned Additional District Judge Sialkot categorically alleged that he was pursuing the case on his behalf as well as on behalf of other petitioners and that he being a heart patient had fallen seriously ill on the fixed date of hearing i.e. 16.9.2013 and learned trial Court was so informed by his counsel with a request for adjournment but the learned trial Court did not accede to the request and  dismissed  the  suit  under  order  17  rule  3  of  Code  of  Civil Procedure 1908. Petitioners“†contention that he had fallen seriously ill on 16.9.2013 is not supported by any medical certificate. Admittedly neither Sh.Khalid Mehmood petitioner No.1 nor his witnesses were present before the learned trial Court on the fixed date i.e. 16.9.2013. Learned Appellate Court in the impugned judgment dated 25.6.2014 scanned the record produced by the petitioners along with the appeal and rightly observed that the same fails to substantiate the petitioner”≥ plea of ailment on the relevant date. It is therefore a case of willful default. In the attending circumstances the learned trial Court had no option but to exercise his jurisdiction in terms of Order 17 Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure 1908. Reliance be made upon  Ghulam Qadir alias  Qadir  Bakhsh  v.  Haji  Muhammad  Suleman  and  6  others (PLD 2003 Supreme Court 180).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.                 Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  has  vehemently\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nargued that the learned trial Court was obliged to furnish an opportunity to the petitioner at least to record his own statement.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nPerusal of the record transpires that neither the petitioner was present on the fixed date before the Court nor any such request was made by the learned counsel for the petitioner to the learned trial Court. No application was lodged by the learned counsel for the petitioner before the learned trial Court with a request for recording the statement of the petitioner. Even no such request was made by the petitioner in his grounds of appeal before the learned Appellate Court. In the above noted circumstances it will be advantageous to seek guidance from a dictum laid down by the Hon”¢le Supreme Court of Pakistan reported as  Syd Tahir Hussain Mehmoodi and others v. Agha Syed Liaqat Ali and  others   (2014  SCMR  637).  The  relevant  extract  of  the  above citation reads below:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n”¥.       Notwithstanding our refraining to interfere in the matter on account of the above, we are of the candid view that provisions of Order XVII, Rule 3, C.P.C. are penal in nature and as per the settled law such provisions should be strictly construed and applied, therefore once the case of a delinquent litigant squarely falls within the purview and mischief of the law (ibid) then neither any concession should be shown to such litigant nor a lenient view favouring him should be resorted to; this should not even be permissibly done on the touchstone of exercise of discretionary power of the court and/or on the approach that technicalities of procedure should not be allowed to impede the interest  of justice,  and/or  that  the litigants should not be knocked out on technical grounds, and that adversarial lis should be settled on merits. If such approach is liberally followed and resorted to there shall be no discipline in the adjudication of the civil litigation and the delinquent whose case though is squarely hit and covered by the penal provisions of Order XVII, Rule 3, C.P.C. would be given a chance to his advantage and to the  disadvantage  of  his  opposing  side.  This  is  not  the spirit  of the law  at  all.  It may not be out  of place to mention here that to apply and to adhere to law is not a mere technicality, rather it is duty cast upon the court as per Article 4 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 to do so. Thus where Order XVII, Rule 3, C.P.C. is duly attracted, the court has no option except to take action in accord therewith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.         In the above context, it may be held that in every case where the action against the delinquent party is imperative and his evidence has to be closed because the case squarely and eminently falls within the mischief of Order XVII, Rule 3, C.P.C., the court while closing the evidence is not in any manner obliged to adjourn the case and require or ask the litigant to appear and examine himself as a witness on a subsequent date. Obviously if the party is present in the court and desires to appear as a\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nwitness the court should not decline his request, rather it shall be appropriate that where the party is present, the court while applying Order XVII, Rule 3, C.P.C. and closing the evidence on a given date should itself ask the party to avail the chance of appearing as his own witness, and should also record such fact in its order (order sheet) that a chance was given to the litigant which has not been availed. However, if this fact is not so recorded by the court though the party was present and sought its examination such party should initially move an application to the court for examination if the case has not yet been decided. But where the case is finally decided a ground should be specifically set in the memo of appeal/revision as the case may be about the presence of the party and asking for the examination, which should be supported by an affidavit of the counsel for the said party to the above effect.‘ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n8.                 Besides  it  is  evident  on  the  record  that  on  25.6.2013 petitioners“†evidence was not available and the time was granted on their request for the sake of justice with the caution of absolute last opportunity subject to the payment of the cost. Despite above noted caution petitioners miserably failed to produce evidence on the fixed date i.e. 16.9.2013 therefore learned trial Court was justified in applying the penal provision of Order 17 Rule 3 of Code of Civil Procedure 1908 through impugned order dated 16.9.2013 which is rightly maintained by the learned Appellate Court. I do not find any legal infirmity, material irregularity or jurisdictional error in the impugned order and judgment passed by learned courts below. Petitioners have no case to invoke the revisional jurisdiction of this Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.                 Case law cited by learned counsel for the petitioners is distinguishable on facts and not helpful to the petitioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.               For the above reasons, this revision petition having no\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nmerit is dismissed in limine.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nApproved for reporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(ABDUS SATTAR ASGHAR) JUDGE\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n “Ö ja z“†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'PLD 1989 Supreme Court 416, PLD 1989 Karachi 404, 2011 SCMR 408, 1998 CLC 1331, PLD 2012 Supreme Court 923, PLD 1993 Supreme Court 341, 1992 SCMR 1202, 2014 SCR 43, PLD 2012 Supreme Court 1089, PLD 2010 Supreme Court 1109, PLD 2012 Supreme Court 774, PLD 2012 Sipreme Court (AJ&K) 42, PLD 2011 Supreme Court 407, PLD 1993 Supreme Court 473, PLD 2011 Supreme Court 963, PLD 1964 Supreme Court 673, PLD 2001 Supreme Court 607, 1994 CLC 2339, PLJ 1978 Supreme Court (AJ & K) 2, PLD 1959 Supreme Court 387, PLD 2010 Supreme Court 265, PLD 1997 Supreme Court 32, PLD 2000 Supreme Court 869, PLD 1996 Supreme Court 324, PLD 2013 Supreme Court 501PLD 1994 Supreme Court 105PLD 1998 Supreme Court 161, PLD 1960 Lahore 757, PLD 2010 Supreme Court 61, PLD 2012 Supreme Court 1, PLD 1983 Quetta 52, PLD 2003 Journal 41, 1930 All ER 671, 1976 2 All ER 367, AIR 1955 SC 781, AIR 1963 (sic) 1019'),

Mubasher and Sarfraz (appellants) have filed Criminal Appeal No.2377 of 2010 against the judgment dated 22.09.2010, whereby, after having been tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kamalia in the above mentioned case, they were convicted and sentenced as under:-\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n”µ1. ...therefore, I hold the accused Mubasher S/o Shah Nawaz guilty of murder of Muzammal Hussain deceased and convict the accused Mubasher u/s 302(b) PPC and sentenced him to Death as Tazir. He shall be hanged by neck  till  he  be  dead  subject  to  confirmation  by  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHon”¢le Lahore High Court, Lahore and I also convict the accused u/s 324 and 337-F.3 PPC for making murderous assault on the person of Aurang-zaib (injured PW) and sentence him for 5 years R.I. and a fine of Rs.20,000/- and also pay DAMAN to Aurang-zaib injured. In case of default in payment of fine he shall undergo 6 months S.I. While accused Sarfraz S/o Bahadar is also held guilty of murder of Muzammal Hussain alongwith co-accused Mubasher as with his common intention he accompanied the  main  culprit,  so  in  the  peculiar  circumstances,  I convict Sarfraz accused u/s 302 (b) read with Section 34\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPPC  and  sentenced him  to  Imprisonment for  Life  as\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“îAZIR“Æ\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n52.   Each accused shall also pay Rs.One Lac separately to the legal heirs of the deceased as compensation u/s\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n544-A, Cr.P.C, in default, each accused shall further undergo 6  months S.I. The benefit of  Section 382-B, Cr.P.C, is however, given to both the accused persons.‘ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe learned trial court has sent Murder Reference No.516 of\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2010 for confirmation or otherwise of the sentence of death awarded to Mubasher (appellant) as required under Section 374, Code of Criminal Procedure.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.                 Precisely,  facts  of  the  case,  as  contained  in  F.I.R. (Exh.PA/1) registered on the basis of statement (Exh.PA) of Muhammad Yasin complainant (PW.10) are that he was resident of Mauza Burhan Kamalia and a labourer. On 10.04.2009, at about 05:30 p.m. Muzammal Hussain the brother of complainant alongwith Aurangzaib son of Sajwar caste Wattoo resident of same village were\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\ngoing to Government Middle School Sheikh Burhan for playing volleyball and when they reached the main gate of the school, they were ambushed by Mubashar (appellant No.1) son of Master Shah Nawaz caste Chishti and Sarfraz (appellant No.2) son of Bahadur Ali caste Tarkhan residents of same village, as they were already hidden inside the gate of the school.  Mubasher (appellant) who was armed with 30 bore pistol, made two successive fire shots out of which, one fire shot hit Muzammal Hussain in front of his throat whereas second fire hit Aurangzeb at his left arm. Complainant alongwith Umar Daraz son  of Nazir Ahmed, Ghulam Abbas son  of Ghulam caste Bhatti residents of the same village while witnessing the occurrence nearby, reached at the place of occurrence. On seeing the complainant”≥ side, the assailants decamped towards Syed Musa Road on a motorcycle. The complainant”≥ side attended Muzammal Hussain, who had fallen on the ground but due to firearm injury, he had succumbed to the injuries.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.                 The motive behind the occurrence as alleged in the FIR was that two days prior to the occurrence, an altercation had taken place between complainant”≥ brother Muzammal Hussain (deceased) and Mubasher (appellant) and due to that grudge, Mubasher and Sarfraz   (appellants)   in   furtherance   of   their   common   intention, murdered complainant”≥ brother namely Muzammal Hussain (deceased) and caused injuries to Aurangzaib.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5.                 On  10.04.2009,  Muhammad  Suleman  S.I/Investigating Officer (PW.12) was posted at Police Station Saddar Kamalia and on the same day when he was on patrol duty at Bypass Chowk Mull Fatiana Road when Muhammad Yasin complainant (PW.10) appeared before him and made his statement (Exh.PA) and he sent the same through  Muhammad  Ajmal  196/C  to  the  Police  Station  Saddar Kamalia for registration of formal FIR. Thereafter, he proceeded to the place of occurrence where dead body of Muzammal Hussain (deceased) was lying. He inspected the dead body, prepared injury\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nstatement (Exh.PD), inquest report (Exh.PE) and sent the dead body to  Tehsil  Headquarters  Hospital,  Kamalia  through  Iftikhar  Ahmad\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n590/C for postmortem examination. He inspected the place of occurrence, prepared rough site plan (Exh.PL) and collected blood stained earth and made it into a sealed parcel which was taken into possession   vide   recovery   memo   (Exh.PM).   He   drafted   injury statement (Exh.PG) of Aurangzaib injured (PW.11) and sent him for medical  examination  through  Rehman  Zaheer  963/C.  After postmortem examination, Iftikhar Ahmad 590/C handed over the I.O. the last worn clothes of Muzammal Hussain (deceased) viz shalwar (P.1), shirt (P.2) and bunyan (P.3) which were taken into possession vide recovery memo  (Exh.PH). On 18.04.2009, Muhammad Yasin Patwari (PW.3) prepared scaled site plans (Exh.PB and Exh.PB/1) and handed over to him on 20.04.2009. On 27.04.2009, he arrested Mubasher and Sarfraz (appellants). On 29.04.2009, during investigation, Sarfraz (appellant) made disclosure and allegedly led to the recovery  of motorcycle  which  was  taken  into  possession  vide recovery memo (Exh.PK). On 27.04.2009, Mubasher (appellant) made disclosure and allegedly led to the recovery of .30 bore pistol (P.4) alongwith three live bullets (Exh.P.5/1-3) and the same were taken into possession vide recovery memo (Exh.PJ). Thereafter, Mubasher and Sarfraz (appellants) were sent to judicial lockup. After completion of investigation, a report under Section 173 Code of Criminal Procedure   was   prepared   and   sent   to   the   Court   of   competent jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6.                 The appellants were summoned by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kamalia, to face the trial. Copies of the documents, as required under Section 265-C, Code of Criminal Procedure, were provided to them and formal charge under Sections 302, 324 and 34\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPPC was framed against them on 01.07.2009 to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove its case, prosecution examined as many as twelve witnesses, in all. Ocular account was furnished by Muhammad Yasin complainant (PW.10) and Aurangzaib\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n(PW.11). Medical evidence was furnished by Dr. Shaukat Ali (PW.6) who conducted postmortem examination on the dead body of Muzammal  Hussain  (deceased)  and  by  Dr.  Jawad  Ahmad  Khan (PW.7) who medically examined Aurangzaib injured (PW.11). Manzoor Hussain (PW.9) witnessed the recovery of .30 bore pistol (P.4) allegedly at the instance of Mubasher (appellant). He also witnessed  the  recovery of  motorcycle  allegedly at  the  instance  of Sarfraz (appellant). Muhammad Suleman S.I. (PW.12) investigated this case and while appearing in the witness box, narrated the various steps taken by him during the course of investigation.   Rest of the witnesses are formal in nature. Learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up PW Nasir Ahmad son of Muhammad Fazil being unnecessary vide statement dated 07.01.2010. Learned Assistant District Public Prosecutor gave up PW Karam Sher being unnecessary vide statement dated 15.04.2010. Learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor gave up PWs Umar Daraz and Ghulam Abbas being unnecessary vide statement dated 24.06.2010. After tendering in evidence report of Chemical Examiner (Exh.PQ) and report of Serologist (Exh.PR) learned Deputy District Public Prosecutor closed the case of prosecution vide statement dated 05.08.2010. Statements of the appellants were recorded under Section 342, Code of Criminal Procedure on 07.08.2010 wherein they refuted all the prosecution allegations levelled against them. To a question as to why this case against him and why the prosecution witnesses had deposed against him, Mubasher (appellant) replied as under:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n‘îhe case is false. The PWs are related iner-se who have deposed falsely on the instance of complainant the real brother of deceased.‘ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo another question had he anything else to say, Mubasher (appellant)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nreplied as under:-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n‘â  am  innocent.  The  case  is  based  on  a  false  and concocted   story   made   by   the   complainant   party   in\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nconnivance  with  the  local  police.  The  I.O.  was  fully  in league  with  the  complainant party  and  had  avoided  to record the statements of the defence witnesses appeared many a times before him during the investigation of this case. In fact prior to the alleged occurrence real uncle of deceased Nazir Ahmed got a case registered against me and others for assaulting his wife Mst. Mubeen Bibi. Muzammal Hussain deceased got a case registered u/s 18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZ.HO against me, Tariq Farooq Chishti etc, assaulting his two sisters, but above mentioned cases were cancelled during the investigation. So Muzammal Hussain deceased nursed grudge against me and had been threatening us to avenge the insult of the woman folk of his family, by attempting to commit rape with my wife and other girls of my family. The ladies of my family avoided to get outside their  houses  alone  being  scared  of  deceased.  On  the fateful day my wife Mst. Mubeen Bibi accompanied by my mother Mst. Mumtaz Begum went to Adda Said Mousa to fetch medicine. I also went after them. On our way back to our village I stopped at a shop on the road side to purchase grocery articles, my mother and wife were leading to village and when they reached near the gate of the school, Muzammal Hussain deceased came out from the gate where he had laid in ambush and was waiting for the arrival of our ladies. The deceased caught hold of my wife from her arms and tried to drag her inside the school premises. On hue and cry of my wife and my mother I rushed to the spot and tried to intervene but the deceased shouted that he would avenge the insult of his family by raping Mst. Mubeen Bibi and continued to drag her. Under grave and sudden provocation, loosing self control and in order to defend the charicity of my wife I fired at the deceased. Aurangzaib Pw also reached there and intervened who also received a  fire shot by chance. None of the PWs except  Aurangzaib  was  present  at  the  spot.  Sarfraz\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\naccused  was  also  not  present  there.  He  was  falsely involved in this case due to come ulterior motive.‘ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo a question as to why this case against him and why the prosecution witnesses had deposed against him, Sarfraz (appellant) replied as under:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n‘îhe case is false. The PWs have deposed falsely on the instance of complainant being closely related iner-se.‘ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe appellants did not appear as their own witnesses in disproof  of  the  prosecution  allegations  as  provided  under  Section\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n340(2)  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure.  Sarfraz  (appellant)  did  not produce any evidence in his defence. However, Mubashar (appellant) got examined his wife Robina Mubasher as DW.1 in his defence who stated as under:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n”∑ years ago I was married to Mubasher accused present in court. We have three issues from the wedlock. Two  years  before,  Muzammal deceased got a case registered against my husband Mubasher accused for assaulting his sisters which was cancelled. Muzammal threatened avenge his insult. On 10.04.2009 I was ill being pregnant in advance stage  and  has  gone  to  fetch  medicines from  the doctor  alongwith  my  husband  Mubasher  accused and mother in law Mst. Mumtaz Bibi from Adda Pull Said Moosa. When we reached back at about 5.00 pm. In the evening on foot in front of main Gate of Village School, my husband Mubasher straight back to purchase Cigarettes etc, from the shop. The moment  I  and  my  mother  in  law  Mumtaz  Bibi reached in front of the Gate of Village school the deceased Muzammal suddenly emerged out of the school and tried to pull me in side the school by holding my arm. I and Mumtaz Bibi raised hue and\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\ncry  attracting my  husband  Mubasher to  the  spot. Mubasher accused asked Muzammal deceased to leave me and get aside. The deceased did not abandon me  and  said  that  he  would  avenge  the insult.  In   order  to   save  my  honour  Mubasher accused started fire at the deceased. One of the fire shot had hit a person standing nearby. Mubasher accused took me and my mother in law to the house whereas, Muzammal had fallen injured. We became aware that Muzammal had expired, then we took a Dala and went to Ahmed Pur Sial. After 2/3 days Arshad elder brother of Mubasher accused brought us to the P.S. and produced Mubasher accused. We narrated the true version to the police but they did not listen to us by saying that the case had already been registered. We approached DPO, T.T. Singh who send us to the P.S. and said that he had contacted the Police Station on telephone. We again contacted the P.S. but no body was ready to listen us. Concocted version was fabricated by the complainant party and my husband was falsely involved in this case.‘ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n7.                 After  conclusion  of  the  trial,  the  learned  trial  court convicted and sentenced both the appellants as detailed above. Hence, this appeal and murder reference.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n8.                 Learned  counsel  for the  appellants,  in  support  of  this appeal, contends that both the appellants have falsely been implicated in this case; that as per prosecution the occurrence took place at 05:30 p.m and it is the case of the complainant in his cross examination that after the occurrence he reached the spot with police after about 10 minutes in service vehicle whereas the FIR was chalked out at 07:30 p.m i.e. two hours after the occurrence with due deliberations and consultations; that the complainant was not present at the time of occurrence   as   he  attributed   only  two   fire   shots   to   Mubasher\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n(appellant) whereas there were two entry wounds on the person of Muzammal Hussain (deceased) and one entry wound on the person of Aurangzaib injured (PW.11); that perhaps realizing this discrepancy the  complainant  while  appearing  before  the  learned  trial  court improved his version and stated that one fire shot had hit on the neck in front of Muzammal Hussain (deceased), the second fire shot had hit him on the chest and the third fire shot which he had made hit on the left arm of Aurangzaib PW; that the complainant was duly confronted with the contents of his earlier statement (Exh.PA) which became basis for registration of the FIR and the improvement was brought on the record; that conduct of the complainant is also highly improbable as instead of shifting his brother Muzammal Hussain and Aurangzaib (PW.11) to the hospital for medical treatment he rushed to the Police to  report  the  crime;  that  the  complainant  was  resident  of  mauza Sheikh Burhan, which village as per cross examination of Muhammad Suleman (PW.12) was at a distance of about one kilometer from the place of occurrence; that it is the case of the prosecution that Muzammal Hussain (deceased) and Aurangzaib injured (PW.11) were going to Government Middle School, mauza Sheikh Burhan to play volleyball but the complainant has not assigned any reason in the FIR or before the learned trial court as why he alongwith two others was following the deceased as well as the injured; that though Aurangzaib (PW.11) was injured during the incident but while appearing before the learned trial court he has not furnished the true account of the incident and as such mere firearm injury on the person of Aurangzaib would not make him a truthful witness; that a vague motive was set out in the FIR as well as before the learned trial court which is to the effect that two days prior to the occurrence an altercation had taken place between Muzammal Hussain (deceased) and Mubasher (appellant) but no details of the motive such as to where, when and why the altercation took place have been disclosed by the prosecution; that Muhammad Suleman S.I (PW.12) stated during the course of cross examination that he did not examine any witness in support of\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nthe motive behind the occurrence; that the alleged recovery of pistol\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n30 bore (P.4) at the instance of Mubasher (appellant) does not advance the case of prosecution as no crime empty was collected from the spot and there is no report of Forensic Science Laboratory.  So far as the case against Sarfraz (appellant No.2) is concerned, learned counsel for the appellants submits that no overt act was attributed to the said appellant in the FIR as well as before the learned trial court except his mere presence at the spot; that recovery of motorcycle at the instance of Sarfraz (appellant) is also not helpful for the prosecution because no registration number or any other description of the motorcycle is mentioned in the FIR or disclosed before the learned trial court; that the motive was also alleged exclusively against Mubasher (appellant), therefore, the element of common intention is missing in this case. Learned counsel further contends that there are material contradictions in the prosecution evidence as in the FIR time of reporting the crime to the Police is mentioned as 7:30 p.m whereas Iftikhar Ahmad Constable No.590(PW.8) stated during his cross examination that they (Police party) received the information about the occurrence at about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8:30  p.m;  that  it  is  the  case  of  the  complainant  in  his  cross examination that the Investigating Officer (PW.12) recorded the statement of Aurangzaib injured (PW.11) at the spot; that the Investigating Officer (PW.12) stated during his cross examination that Aurganzaib injured was conscious when he visited the place of occurrence whereas Aurangzaib (PW.11) stated during his cross examination that after receiving firearm injury he became unconscious and came into senses two three hours thereafter in the hospital; that viewing from all angles the prosecution case is doubtful in nature and the appellants are entitled to the benefit of doubt not as a matter of grace but as of right; that version of Mubasher (appellant No.1) disclosed by him in his statement recorded under Section 342, Code of Criminal Procedure and put to the witnesses of ocular account as well as  the  Investigating  Officer  during  their  cross  examination  and\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nsupported  by  the  statement  of  Robina  Mubasher  (DW.1)  is  more\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nprobable and gets support from the prosecution”≥ own case.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n9.                 On the other hand, learned Deputy Prosecutor General, assisted by learned counsel for the complainant vehemently opposes this appeal on the grounds that this broad daylight occurrence took place  at  05:30  p.m  on  10.04.2009  whereas  Aurangzaib  injured (PW.11) was medically examined on the same evening at 07:00 p.m and even post mortem examination on the dead body of Muzammal Hussain (deceased) was also conducted on the same night at 09:00 p.m i.e. within four hours of the incident which establishes presence of the complainant and other witness of ocular account at the spot; that no adverse inference can be drawn against the prosecution due to conduct of the complainant as human conduct varies from person to person and in the peculiar circumstances of the case the complainant preferred to report the crime to the Police prior to having resort to the medical treatment; that the complainant being a commoner was not expected to give the exact details of injuries and that too in a situation of perplexity and panic when his real brother was shot dead at the hands  of  the  appellants;  that  the  other  witness  of  ocular  account namely Aurangzaib (PW.11) was injured in the incident and he was medically examined on the same evening at 07:00 p.m i.e. just one hour and thirty minutes after the occurrence and even otherwise his presence at the spot has not been disputed by the defence; that the motive has fully been proved by the prosecution and the same was not even  disputed  by  the  defence;  that  the  ocular  account  is  fully supported by the medical evidence; that the prosecution case is corroborated by the recovery of pistol 30 bore (P.4) at the instance of Mubasher (appellant) which was taken into possession vide recovery memo (Exh.PJ) and similarly motorcycle through which both the appellants  fled  away  after  the  occurrence  was  recovered  at  the instance of Sarfraz (appellant) which was taken into possession vide recovery memo (Exh.PK); that Mubasher (appellant) committed brutal murder of Muzammal Hussain brother of the complainant by making\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\ntwo successive fire shots and under the circumstances he does not deserve any leniency even in the quantum of his sentence; that Sarfraz (appellant No.2) ambushed at the place of occurrence alongwith the principal accused and after the occurrence fled away with him on a motorcycle which was recovered at his instance, therefore, he shared common intention with Mubasher (appellant) and was vicariously liable for the act of his co-accused. So far as version of Mubashar (appellant No.1) is concerned, learned Deputy Prosecutor General and learned counsel for the complainant contend that the same is just an afterthought; that it was never alleged by the defence that Muzammal Hussain   (deceased)   was   armed   with   any   firearm  and   in   that eventuality it does not appeal to common sense that he caught hold of Robina Mubasher wife of Mubasher (appellant No.1) and wanted to commit rape with her specially when according to the statement of Robina Mubasher (DW.1) at the time of occurrence her pregnancy was at advance stage; that Mst Mumtaz Begum mother of Mubasher (appellant No.1) who was also accompanying Robina Mubasher at the time of her alleged dragging was not produced by the appellant in his defence; that there is no merit in this appeal and the same is liable to be dismissed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n10.                We have heard learned counsel for the appellants as well as learned Deputy Prosecutor General for the State assisted by learned counsel for the complainant at a considerable length and have also gone through the record with their able assistance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n11.                Admittedly, it is a case of two versions. One set out by the prosecution in the F.I.R (Exh.PA/1) and brought on the record through the statements of the eye witnesses namely Muhammad Yasin complainant (PW.10) and Aurangzaib injured (PW.11) and the second disclosed  by Mubasher  (appellant  No.1) in his  statement  recorded under Section 342, Code of Criminal Procedure put to Aurangzaib injured (PW.11) as well as the Investigating Officer (PW.12) during their cross examination and supported by the defence witness namely\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nRubina Mubasher (DW.1). In such like situation, the Court is required to  first  analyze  the  prosecution  case  in  order  to  ascertain  its truthfulness or otherwise. In this respect, we are guided by the judgment of the Hon”¢le Supreme Court of Pakistan passed in the case reported as ‘Åshiq Hussain versus State‘†(PLD 1994 SC 879) wherein, at page 883, the Hon”¢le Supreme Court has been pleased to observe as under: -\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n”π.     ∆îhe proper and the legal way of dealing with a criminal case is that the Court should first discuss the prosecution case/evidence in order to come to an independent finding  with regard to  the  reliability of  the prosecution witnesses, particularly the eye-witnesses and the probability of the story told by them, and then examine the statement of the accused under section 342, Cr.P.C., statement under section 340(2), Cr.P.C. and the defence evidence. If  the  Court  disbelieves/rejects/excludes from consideration the  prosecution evidence, then  the  Court must accept the statement of the accused as a  whole without  scrutiny.  If  the  statement  under  section  342, Cr.P.C. is exculpatory, then he must be acquitted. If the statement under section 342, Cr.P.C. believed as a whole, constitutes some offence punishable under the Code/law, then the  accused should be  convicted for  that offence only.  In  case  of  counterversions, if  the  Court  believes prosecution evidence and is not prepared to exclude the same from consideration, it will not straightaway convict the accused but will review the entire evidence including the circumstances appearing the case at close before reaching at a conclusion regarding the truth or falsity of the defence plea/version. All the factors favouring belief in the accusation must be placed in juxtaposition to the corresponding factors favouring the plea in defence and the total effect should be estimated in relation to the questions, viz., is the plea/version raised by the accused satisfactorily     established     by     the     evidence     and\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\ncircumstances appearing in the case? If the answer be in the affirmative, then the Court must accept the plea of the accused and act accordingly. If the answer to the question be  in  the  negative,  then  the  Court  will  not  reject  the defence plea as being false but will go a step further to find out whether or not there is yet a reasonable possibility of defence plea/version being true. If the Court finds that although the accused has failed to establish his plea/version to the satisfaction of the Court but his plea might reasonably be true, even then the Court must accept his plea and acquit or convict him accordingly.‘ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe above view of the hon”¢le apex court of the country has been reiterated in another judgment reported as ‘Åmin Ali versus The State‘†(2011 SCMR 323), therefore, following the principles settled by the hon”¢le Supreme Court of Pakistan in such like situation, we will first, examine the case of the prosecution.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n12.               Case of the prosecution has been discussed in para  3 above.   Gist of the same is that on 10.04.2009, at about 05:30 p.m. Muzammal   Hussain   (deceased)   alongwith   Aurangzaib   injured (PW.11) were going to Government Middle School Sheikh Burhan for playing volleyball and when they reached the main gate of school, Mubasher (appellant No.1) and Sarfraz (appellant No.2) ambushed them as they were already inside the gate of the school.   Mubasher (appellant) who was armed with 30 bore pistol, made two successive fire shots out of which, one fire shot hit Muzammal Hussain in front of his throat whereas second fire hit Aurangzeb at his left arm. Complainant alongwith Umar Daraz and Ghulam Abbas while witnessing the occurrence nearby, reached at the place of occurrence. On seeing the complainant”≥ side, the assailants decamped towards Syed Musa Road on a motorcycle. The complainant”≥ side attended Muzammal Hussain, who had fallen on the ground and succumbed to the injuries.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n13.               This unfortunate incident, wherein Muzammal Hussain brother of the complainant lost his life whereas Aurangzaib (PW.11) received  firearm  injury  as  per  FIR  (Exh.PA/1)  took  place  on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.04.2009 at 05:30 p.m. at the main gate of Government Middle School Sheikh Burhan District Tob Tek Singh.   Aurangzaib injured was medically examined on the same evening at 07:00 p.m and even post mortem examination on the dead body of Muzammal Hussain (deceased) was also conducted on the same night at 09:00 p.m and the probable time between the death and post mortem examination noted by Dr Shaukat Ali (PW.6) was two to four hours which is in line with the time of occurrence stated by the prosecution.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n14.               First of all  we take up the case of Sarfraz (appellant No.2).    In  the  FIR  except  mere  presence  no  overt  act  has  been attributed to the said appellant.  There were only firearm injuries on the person of the deceased as well as Aurangzaib injured.   There is neither any allegation that he was carrying any firearm at the time of occurrence nor any firearm was recovered from him during the course of  investigation.    The only incriminating  evidence  against  Sarfraz (appellant) is the recovery of motorcycle which was taken into possession vide recovery memo (Exh.PK).   Registration number or any other description of the motorcycle is not mentioned in the FIR or disclosed before the learned trial court.  The prosecution has also not specified as to who was driving the motorcycle when the assailants decamped from the place of occurrence and above all the recovery of motorcycle was not put to Sarfraz (appellant No.2) while recording his statement under Section 342, Code of Criminal Procedure.    It is settled  principle  of law  that  the piece of  evidence not  put  to  the accused during his examination under Section 342, Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be used against him for recording his conviction. While holding so, we are fortified by the dictum of law laid down by the hon”¢le Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case reported as ‘çuhammad Shah versus The State‘†(2010 SCMR 1009).   We have not been able to find out any other piece of evidence against\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nSarfraz (appellant No.2) except the recovery of motorcycle, which cannot be used against him in view of the dictum of law laid down in Muhammad Shah”≥ case (supra).   Therefore, while holding that the prosecution failed to connect Sarfraz (appellant No.2) with the commission of crime, this appeal to his extent is allowed and he is acquitted of the charges. He is in jail.  He be released forthwith if not required to be detained in any other case.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n15.               Now we are left with the case of Mubasher (appellant No.1).   Ocular account in this case was furnished by Muhammad Yasin complainant (PW.10) and Aurangzaib injured (PW.11).   It is the case of the complainant in the FIR that Mubasher (appellant) who was armed with 30 bore pistol, made two successive fire shots out of which, one fire shot hit Muzammal Hussain in front of his throat whereas second fire hit Aurangzaib at his left arm.  During the post mortem examination of Muzammal Hussain (deceased) Dr Shaukat Ali (PW.6) noted two firearm entry wounds on the dead body of Muzammal Hussain (deceased).  Perhaps realizing this contradiction the complainant improved his statement while appearing before the learned trial court and stated that one fire shot had hit on the neck in front of Muzammal Hussain (deceased), the second fire shot had hit him on the chest and the third fire shot which he had made hit on the left arm of Aurangzaib PW. The complainant was duly confronted with his earlier statement (Exh.PA) which became basis for the registration of FIR and the improvement was brought on the record. Following portion of his cross examination is relevant, which is reproduced as under:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n‘â had mentioned in my statement Exh.PA that the second fire shot of Mubasher had hit the deceased on his chest. Confronted with Exh.PA where it is not so recorded.‘ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is obvious that this improvement was made by the complainant to strengthen the prosecution case.  It is well settled by now that when a witness improves his statement to strengthen the prosecution case and\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nthe  moment   it  is  concluded  that  the  improvement   was  made deliberately and with mala fide the testimony of such witness does not remain reliable.  While holding so we are fortified by the dictum of law laid down by hon”¢le Supreme Court of Pakistan in the cases reported as ‘çuhammad Rafique and others versus ', 'PLD 2007 Karachi 139, PLD 2007 Karachi 140, PLD 2010 Supreme Court 1021, Suo Motu Case No.24 of 2007, PLD 2009 Supreme Court 460');

Respondent by        Ch. Muhammad Khalid Dogar, Advocate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr.Waqas  Qadeer  Dar,  Deputy  Attorney\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nIjaz ul Ahsan, J:  The appellant is aggrieved of an order\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\ndated  20.10.2010  passed  by  a  learned  Single  Bench  of  this Court. Through the impugned order a constitutional  petition filed by respondent No.1 was allowed and a demand of Rs.19,000/- as service and warranty charges made by the appellant  and  respondent  No.4  was  declared  to  have  been created without lawful authority and of no legal effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.       Facts  of  the  case  are  that  respondent  No.1  booked  a tractor through respondent No.4 by availing a loan facility from Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited, Pasroor. The appellant asked respondent No.1 to present a demand draft for delivery of the tractor and the same was presented. Subsequently, a further amount of Rs.19,000/- was demanded as service and warranty charges which was challenged before this Court through a constitutional petition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.     It appears that the actual price of the tractor was Rs.3,20,000/-  and  the  demand  of  Rs.19,000/-  was  over  and above the said price by way of service and warranty charges.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nThe said charges were contested on the ground that the same were violative of SRO No.839(I)/98 issued by the Federal Government.  After  hearing  the  parties,  the  learned  Single Bench allowed the petition and held the claim of the aforenoted amount of Rs.19,000/- to have been created without lawful authority. The said order is impugned in this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.       The learned counsel for the appellant has mainly argued that  the  appellant  as  well  as  respondent  No.4  are  private persons.  No  writ  could  be  issued  against  them  in  terms  of Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1973. He maintains that it is an established principle of law that an order under Article 199 of the Constitution can only be made against  a person  who  is  performing  functions in  connection with  the  affairs  of  the  Federation,  a  province  or  a  local authority. He maintains that the appellant does not fall in any of the aforesaid categories and being a limited company with private management and shareholders was not amenable to the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.       The  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent,  on  the  other hand, has supported the impugned judgment. He maintains that an unlawful demand had been raised by the appellant company and this Court has the jurisdiction to interfere in matters, in which injustice is being done. Further the appellant company is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan,  which  is  a  state  functionary,  as  such  the  learned Single  Bench  was  justified  in  interfering  in  the  matter  and\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nissuing   a   writ   restraining   the   appellant   from   recovering warranty and service charges of Rs.19,000/- from respondent No.1 in an illegal and unlawful manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.       We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record. The only question requiring determination by this Court is whether a writ could be issued against a private company, which has private management and private shareholders. On hearing the learned counsel for the parties and examination of the record, our response to the said query is in the negative for the following reasons:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni)     This  Court  exercises  jurisdiction  subject  to  the Constitution and the law. Writ jurisdiction is exercised under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1973. The relevant portion of Article 199 of the Constitution is reproduced below for ease of reference:-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n199 Jurisdiction of High Court.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n(1) Subject to the Constitution, a High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law,-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) on the application of any aggrieved party, make an order- (i) directing a person performing, within the territorial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njurisdiction of the Court, functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority, to refrain from doing anything he is not permitted by law to do, or to do anything he is required by law to do;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor≈Æ..\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nA  plain  reading  of  the  portion  of  Article  199  of  the\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nConstitution reproduced above indicates the following:-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI-       Constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court can be invoked subject to the satisfaction of the High\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nCourt that no other adequate remedy is provided by law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII-      On the application of any aggrieved party.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIII-    An order can be issued by this Court directing a person  performing,  within  the  territorial jurisdiction of the Court, functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority,≈Æ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nii)      The word person has been defined under Article 199 of the Constitution in the following terms:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"person" includes any body politic or corporate, any authority   of   or   under   the   control   of   the   Federal Government or of a Provincial Government, and any Court or tribunal, other than the Supreme Court, a High Court or a Court or tribunal established under a law relating to the Armed Forces of Pakistan‘ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere  is  no  denial  of  the  fact  that  the  appellant  is  a limited company incorporated under the provisions of Companies Ordinance, 1984. It is neither owned nor controlled by the Federal Government, a provincial government or a local authority. I have specifically asked the learned counsel for the parties if the Federal Government or the Provincial Government holds majority shares or management control of the appellant. It is admitted by both the learned counsel that such is not the case. It is pointed out that both administrative and financial control of the appellant company is with the board of directors  of the company, which consists of private individuals. Neither the federal government nor a provincial government or a local authority has anything to do with the management or control of\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nthe appellant. As such the mere fact that the appellant is registered under the Companies Ordinance, 1984 and the regulatory authority for  the  companies  is  the  Securities  and Exchange Commission of Pakistan which is run and controlled by the federal government would not bring the appellant within the purview of the definition of a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of the federation, the province or a local authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niii)     In  Salahuddin and 2 others Vs. Frontier Sugar Mills\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n& Distillery Ltd. Tokht Bhai and 10 others  (PLD 1975 SC\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1974), the Hon”¢le Supreme Court of Pakistan dealt with a\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nsimilar proposition and held as follows:-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n‘àowever private organization or persons, as distinguished from government or semi-government agencies   and   functionaries   cannot   be   regarded   as persons performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation or a Province simply for the reason that their activities happen to be regulated by laws made by the State. Accordingly, a joint-stock company, incorporated under the Companies Act, for the purpose of carrying on commercial or industrial activity for the benefit of its shareholders, cannot be regarded as a person performing State functions≈Ö‘ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\niv)     The question of maintainability of constitutional petitions against limited companies has recently been examined by the Hon”¢le Supreme Court of Pakistan in a judgment reported as Abdul Wahab and others Vs. Habib Bank Ltd. and others\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n(2014 PLC (C.S). 393. Mian Saqib Nisar, J writing for the\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nApex Court has held as follows:-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n‘ât is an admitted position that the Bank has been privatized  and  the  majority  shareholding  thereof,  has been acquired and is vested in Agha Khan Foundation, there also is no discord that the Board of Management of HBL  is  predominantly  represented  by  the  said foundation. However, in order to bring the Bank within the purview and the connotations(s) of a “∞erson“†and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“°uthority“†  appearing   in   Articles   199,   199(5)   and\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n199(1)(c) of the Constitution and also for the purposes of urging that appropriate order, in the nature of a writ can be  issued  independently  by  this  Court  under  Article\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n184(3) (Constitution), to the Bank, the learned counsel for  the  petitioners  has  strenuously  relied  upon  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“¶unction test“ª and in this respect it is submitted that the State/Federation has a considerable, shareholding in the Bank and representation in the managing affairs thereto therefore it shall qualify having the status of a person/authority within the meaning of the law; besides, the Bank is being regulated by and under the authority of the State Bank of Pakistan thus on this account as well it (Bank) has the status mentioned above, therefore, this Court should exercise its jurisdiction in terms of the Article supra. In this context, it may be held that for the purposes of resorting to the “¶unction test“¨ two important factors are the most relevant i.e. the extent of financial interest of the State/Federation in an institution and the dominance in the controlling affairs thereof. But when queried, it is not shown if the State/Federation has the majority of shareholding, or majority representation in the Board of Management of the Bank. As regards the authority and the role of the State Bank of Pakistan (in the  above  context),  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  is  only  a\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nregulatory body for all the banks operating in Pakistan in terms  of  Banking  Companies  Ordinance,  1962  and suffice it to say that such regulatory role and control of State Bank of Pakistan shall not clothe the Bank, with the status  of a  “∞erson“†or the “°uthority“†performing the functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation. Rather it shall remain to be a private entity. In support of the above, reliance can be placed on two judgments of this Court reported as Salahuddin and 2 others vs. Frontier Sugar Mills and Distillery Ltd. Takht Bhai and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10  others  (PLD  1975  SC 244),  which  prescribes  that ‘≤egulatory control does not make a person performing functions in relation to the federation or a province‘ª likewise in Pakistan Red Crescent Society and another v. Syed Nazir Gillani (PLD 2005 SC 806) it was held ‘≥uch control must be particular to the body in question and must  be  persuasive≈Æ.  on  the  other  hand,  when  the control is merely regulatory whether under the statute or otherwise it would not serve to make the body a “ìtate“†therefore, we have no hesitation to hold that the Bank is a private institution for all intents and purposes. And we vide short order dated 17.10.2012 has deferred our decision on the issue if such a private person is amenable to writ jurisdiction in the context of Article 199(1)(c) of the Constitution..\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nv)      Admittedly  the  appellant  is  a  private  Company  and cannot be regarded as a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of the federation or the province. In these circumstances, a writ could not have been issued against the appellant in exercise of powers under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n7.       For the reasons recorded above, this appeal is allowed. The    impugned    order    dated    20.10.2010    announced    on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29.10.2010 is set aside.

The said suit was vehemently contested by petitioner by filing written statement on legal and factual grounds. After framing of issues, both the parties adduced their respective evidence, whereafter, learned trial court vide judgment and decree dated 04.10.2013, decreed the suit by directing the petitioner to pay the maintenance to the respondent @ Rs.7000/- per month from November\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2012, till her marriage. Both the parties filed appeals against the said judgment and decree which were also\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\ndismissed vide consolidated judgment and decrees dated 11.03.2014. Hence, this writ petition.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n2.     Learned counsel for petitioner submits that respondent being disobedient/divorced daughter is not entitled  for  any  maintenance  as  she  has  refused  to reside with petitioner. He added that even otherwise quantum of maintenance is excessive and exorbitant as it is beyond the monetary status of the petitioner. Learned counsel for the petitioner further states that the impugned judgments and decrees are the result of misreading and non-reading of evidence, available on record,  therefore,  not  sustainable  in  the eye  of  law being against the law and facts of the case.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n3.       I  have  heard  the  arguments  advanced  by  the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the record.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n4.       The petitioner has contracted second marriage, having two children from second marriage. The respondent alleged maltreatment as well as physical beating on the part of her step mother for which she has refused to reside with petitioner. Petitioner could not rebut the said allegation of maltreatment on the part  of  his  second  wife.  During  the  evidence,  the\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\npetitioner admitted that he  does not enjoy cordial / pleasant relations with his daughter. Petitioner being father was unable to show his love, affection or even intimacy for his daughter and therefore cannot expect from her to return. Under the law a daughter cannot be deprived of her right of maintenance by father during his life time when no instance was mentioned showing disobedience on the part of the daughter. Therefore, plea of the petitioner to disentitle the respondent from maintenance on account of alleged disobedience has no force.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n5.     During the cross examination, the petitioner admitted that he remained posted in Pakistan Ranger for 35 years and retired in 2009 as Deputy Superintendent Ranger. The petitioner is not only drawing  pension of Rs.24,000/- per month  but  also owns  an  ancestral  house  at  Mouza  Narr,  house  at Mouza Darankot with an agricultural land. He also admitted  that  respondent  requires  medical  treatment due to her weak eyesight and stomach diseases. Hence, no illegality has been committed by the courts below in determining the quantum of maintenance.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n6.       It is the duty/obligation of the father to maintain his daughter till her marriage and the same passes on\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nto her husband after her marriage. The liability of the husband continues till the subsistence of the marriage but after the dissolution of marriage, female loses her marital status and liability again shifts toward her father. Petitioner being real father of the respondent is legally and morally bound to maintain his  divorced daughter.   It   is   evident   from   the   evidence   that respondent has no source of income and her expenses are born by her real paternal uncle. This very fact has also been admitted by the petitioner in his cross examination.  Therefore, plea of the petitioner that he is not bound to pay maintenance to respondent after her marriage has no force.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n7.       The respondent being the daughter of petitioner can claim maintenance from her father/petitioner  as her marriage has already been dissolved. In this regard I am persuaded by a judgment of this Court reported as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMian Muhammad Sabir Vs Mst. Uzma Parveen and\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2  others  (PLD  2012  Lahore  154)  which  holds  as\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nunder:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n‘â may here refer to Mahommedan Law by Ameer Ali, 5th  Edition, at page 1367 wherein it is observed that ‘≠arriage does not necessarily absolve the father from the obligation of maintaining his daughter.‘†Again Asaf A.A. Fyzee in his book “èutline of Muhammadan Law“†(IVth   Edition) at page 214, states that a ‘¶ather is bound to maintain his sons until they\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nattain puberty and his daughters until they are married. He is also responsible for the upkeep of his widowed or divorced daughter.‘ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n8.       Furthermore, it is also established that evidence of the petitioner/plaintiff was not credit worthy being contradictory in cross-examination, therefore, learned courts below rightly discarded the evidence, in their impugned judgments and decree. Presently, before this Court as well, learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to point out any misreading or non-reading of material evidence by the courts below, warranting interference by this Court, therefore, this petition has no force.   With respect to interference in concurrent findings  of  the  courts  below,  the  Hon”¢le  Supreme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt of Pakistan in a case reported as  Mst. Farhat\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJabeen  Vs  Muhammad  Safdar  and  others  (2011\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSCMR 1073) has held that:-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n‘ât is settled rule by now that interference in the findings of facts concurrently arrived at by the courts should not be lightly made, merely for the reason that another  conclusion shall be possibly drawn, on  the reappraisal of the evidence; rather interference is restricted to the cases of misreading and non-reading of material evidence which has bearing on the fate of the case.‘ç\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.       In the present case, no such defects have been pointed out by the learned counsel for petitioner in order  to  seek  interference  by  this  Court.  Learned\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\ncourts below have thoroughly examined the entire evidence of the parties and thereafter reached at the conclusion regarding the controversy. Neither any misreading or non-reading of evidence on record nor any infirmity, legal or factual, has been pointed out in the impugned judgments and decrees passed by the learned   courts   below,   therefore,   this   petition   is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n(MASUD ABID NAQVI)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGE\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nApproved for reporting.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nJUDGE\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRouf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'PLD 2013 Supreme Court 793, PLD 2009 Supreme Court 460, 1987 SCMR 1382, 1986 SCMR 1627, 1986 SCMR 1573, 1987 PCr.LJ 2169');

The   challenge   rests   on   the   following   fundamental propositions of constitutional importance:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(i)      Whether the foundational constitutional values of democracy, equality, political, economic and social justice; informed with fundamental rights and the principles of policy, recognize and acknowledge environmental  justice  and  the  international environmental    principles     as    natural    and    integral concomitant of these values, rights and policies?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(ii)     Whether,  the  above  constitutional  values,  rights and policies underline the constitutional requirement of an independent and autonomous regulator (in this case: The Provincial Environmental Protection Agency) to safeguard and protect the most primordial of fundamental rights i.e., right to life, liberty and dignity of the people (Articles 9 and 14), by protecting the most essential element of human life i.e., the environment?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(iii)  Whether  the  constitutional  recognition  and command to establish a third tier of elected self- government under Article 140A of the Constitution, actualizes the constitutional vision of a federalist state and   of   guaranteeing   political,   economic   and   social justice,    encouraging    local    government    institutions\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n(Article 32), the right to liberty, dignity and political participation (Articles 9, 14 and 17)?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(iv)   Whether, the constitutional ethos of Federalism (reinvigorated  through  the  18th    Constitutional amendment)   introduce   a   new   era   of   constitutional maturity complimenting the traditional doctrine of horizontal separation of powers between different organs of the State with a more enlightened constitutional design that in addition accounts for vertical and internal separation of powers within the organs of the State ? And whether there exists vertical separation of powers and corresponding autonomy between the elected Provincial and Local Governments?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(v)     Whether  devolution  and  vertical  separation  of powers       envisaged   under   Article   140A   of   the Constitution allows Lahore Development Authority (LDA),  a  provincial  body,    to  trump  and  usurp  the powers of the elected local governments, which firmly rest on constitutionally devolved political, administrative and financial responsibility and authority under Punjab Local Government Act, 2013 (‘êLGA‘© with clearly delineated   powers ?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(vi)    Whether  Provincial  Legislature   can   curtail   or abridge the powers already devolved under Article 140A and PLGA to the local governments by introducing amendments  in  the  LDA  Act  or  through  introducing other provincial laws?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.       The  Signal  Free  Corridor  Project  is  a  project  that redesigns and remodels existing roads that start from Qartaba Chowk (roundabout) and end at Liberty Market Main Chowk\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nspread over 7 K.Ms of the existing Jail Road and Main Boulevard.    Remodelling  would  convert  this  stretch  into  a signal free, high speed expressway by introducing two underpasses at the Shadman and Fawara Chowks and seven U turns and five overhead pedestrian bridges at a cost of approx.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRs 1.5 billion of the taxpayers“†money.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.       The petitioners submit that LDA inspite of having filed an Environmental Impact Assessment (‘ÖIA‘© with the respondent Provincial Environmental Protection Agency (‘ÖPA‘©,  has  in  total  disregard  of  the law,  that  is,  without seeking the approval of EPA under Section 12 of the Punjab Environmental Protection Act, 1997 (‘êEPA‘© mobilized the works and  illegally commenced the construction of the Project. During the course of hearing, the Advocate General, Punjab confirmed that the EIA approval has been finally granted by the Director General, EPA on 19.03.2015  when the Project had commenced     and after some of the petitioners had already approached this Court on 26.02.2015 by challenging the commencement of the  Project without approval of EIA and before the availability of the EIA Report being made Public. It appears that EPA hurriedly granted the approval and placed it on the record, because the Court had taken cognizance of the matter and had questioned the LDA and the Provincial Government  to  explain  how  the  Project  had  commenced without an EIA approval.    The petitioners in the instant case and  the  subsequent  connected  petitions  (all  of  them  being public interest petitions) have also challenged the said decision of the DG, EPA.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5.       The petitioners, as a community of concerned citizens, have vehemently urged that EPA, currently, is not an autonomous statutory environmental protection agency but  a\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nmere Attached Department of the Provincial Government, functioning on the dictates of the Provincial Government. It is argued that EPA suffers from complete Regulatory Capture by the Provincial Government and hence the impugned decision is a  result  of  dictation  and  non-application  of  an  independent mind. It is argued, that it is not possible for the beleaguered EPA to independently dispense environmental justice, within the statutory framework of PEPA, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Review of IEE and EIA) Regulations, 2000 (‘íegulations‘© and the Environmental Law Guidelines, namely: (i) Policy and Procedure for Filing, Review and Approval of Environmental   Assessments. (ii) Guidelines for the Preparation and Review of Environmental Reports and (iii) Guidelines for Public Consultation. EPA also falls short of protecting  the constitutional  values  of social  justice and  the fundamental rights under the Constitution. As a consequence, it is argued, that the entire  EIA approval process, as well as,  the preparation of the EIA report by the consultant is materially deficient and defective.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6.       The petitioners, as concerned citizens, have also urged this Court to take notice of the sheer absurdity and irrationality of the Project. It is submitted that Rs 1.5 billion, of the tax payers“†money is being spent to convert a 7 km road into a high speed corridor for only 8% motorists of the city, with no regard for the pedestrians, cyclists and other non-motorized persons who are in majority. It is also emphasized that the selection of the Project is at the cost of several other more important development projects in the Lahore Division. They vehemently submit that the sanction of the Project by the LDA, was without application  of  mind  as  is  evident  from  the  minutes  of  the meeting of LDA. They pleaded that while the patients languish\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nin hospitals without doctors and medicines and government schools function without teachers, the need to spend Rs 1.5 billion on a small stretch of road, in the most developed part of Lahore, is cruel, inequitable and undemocratic. They urged that such nakedly irrational development policies are subject to judicial review.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n7.       On the role of LDA versus the Local Government, it was urged that after devolution of political, administrative and financial responsibility and authority to the elected representatives of the local government system under Article\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n140A of the Constitution, and after the provincial legislature having vested the municipal service relating to urban development under PLGA in the Lahore Metropolitan Corporation (‘åMC‘©, LDA has no constitutional authority to initiate the Project within the devolved political, administrative and  financial  space  of  LMC.  It  is  submitted  that  any  such Project can ONLY be initiated and developed by the concerned elected Local Government.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n8.    It  has  been  argued  that  the  conclusions  and recommendations drawn by the EIA Consultant are based on an inadequate, incompetent, unsubstantiated and biased appraisal of the Project, and are liable to be disregarded. The EIA, prepared by LDA, is itself a vacuous document and persistently violates the Guidelines which inform its preparation. The petitioners have given a detailed list of areas in which the EIA falls  short of  the  legal  requirements.  The  summary of  their submissions is as under and references therein are to the EIA Report submitted by LDA before the EPA:-\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nHOW THE PROJECT EIA FALLS SHORT OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS1\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirement with source\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat has been done\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin EIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Description: Objectives; alternatives considered and reasons for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrejection; description of location (with maps and photos of specific locations and layout) including land uses on site and surroundings, details of population centers and nearby dwellings, road access, topographic and vegetation features of site; description of project, including drawings showing project layout, components, etc. (EIA-G: para 2.3, p.6-7 and para 5.2, p. 24)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Ferozepur Road MBS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject explained in more detail than actual Project (para 2.1, pp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11-12)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- States that the link requiring improvements plays\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant role in traffic and transport system of Lahore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- On account of its importance, crossings need improvement, and making it signal-free\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(para 2.2, pp. 12-13)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- No map or photos whatsoever have been given of location.

Major problem lies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin project preparation and planning. Project feasibilities are seldom based on traffic studies. For major projects, traffic counts are usually carried out to save from the scrutiny of the approving agencies, their utility for design solutions is witnessed in rare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprojects. This results towards wasteful expenditure on projects with least priority of traffic demand.

The first and most important of which is to take place during the preparation of the EIA. This is evident from the Scoping requirements laid down. It is at this stage that meaningful and protracted input can be gained from various segments of society, especially those to be directly affected by the proposed projects.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe second is the requirement to hold a public hearing on EIAs, and solicit comments/objections on proposed projects. Given the inherent constraints of such a hearing, and the fact that the scope and nature of the Project has already taken concrete form at this point, this public participation process is far less effective in addressing genuine community concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsultation process in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe assessment process (para 6.1, p. 91), however, it is apparent that a meaningful consultation process has not been carried\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout for the Project.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe EIA states at para\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.2.1 (pp. 91-92) that there are no primary stakeholders for the improvement of Jail Road and Main Boulevard. It groups local residents, shop keepers, vendors, pedestrians, and businessmen of the adjoining markets as secondary stakeholders.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStakeholders are identified in Table 6.2 (p. 93) and it appears that the Consultant has itself surmised as to what their various concerns might be.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is stated that stakeholders (groups/individuals) were briefed about the project, and eventually their queries about the project were answered to their satisfaction (para 6.3.1; p 94).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt goes on to state that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n77% of the respondents favoured the Project whereas 23% were against.

No\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncriteria are given for selecting stakeholders, and the atomised individuals consulted seem to have been selected at random.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJust some of the obvious stakeholders in the Project (some of which have been mentioned in other parts of the EIA) include Kinnaird College, Lahore College for Women (and other education providers along the Project route), Omer Hospital (and other hospitals/clinics on the Project route), owners of major shopping malls and plazas on the route, residents of Gulberg and Shadman, the custodians of the Christian cemetery\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non Jail Road, urban planning and environment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovided.

Brief facts of the case as narrated in the writ petition are that the petitioner Muhammad Zubair Riaz got married with respondent No.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKalsoom Tufail on 08.07.2010 whereafter, the petitioner went to U.K. Respondent No.1 also went there and started living with the petitioner. From the wedlock, a daughter was born on 10.04.2011. After the birth of the child, the parties came to Pakistan and due to some differences, there  was  separation  between  the  parties.  A  divorce  deed  dated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21.10.2011 was sent to respondent No.1 and its copy was sent to the Secretary Union Council which was duly received by him. The Secretary Union Council did not initiate any proceedings upon the said divorce deed/notice. Respondent No.1, thereafter, went back to U.K. and by ignoring the divorce given to her filed a petition before the Birmingham District Registry for dissolution of marriage. The petitioner received notice from the court of Birmingham.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.       After receiving the said notice, the petitioner again filed an application before the Chairman of the Union Council for issuance of\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\ncertificate for confirmation of talaq on the basis of divorce deed dated\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n21.10.2011 but no certificate was issued. Then the petitioner filed a writ petition No.27798/12 before this Court seeking direction to Secretary Union Council for issuance of divorce certificate. The writ petition  was  disposed  of  vide  order  dated  08.11.2012  with  the direction to the Secretary, Union Council to proceed with the matter in accordance with law. Thereafter, the divorce certificate was issued on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17.11.2012. On placing the divorce certificate before the Birmingham Court, the petition filed by respondent No.1 was dismissed vide order dated 19.07.2013.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.       Feeling aggrieved of issuance of divorce certificate, respondent No.1 filed a writ petition before this Court which met with office objection made vide diary No.123622/12 that writ petition was not competent. The objection was also sustained by the Court vide order dated 31.12.2012. It was held in the order dated 31.12.2012 that the writ petitioner had remedy to approach Inspecting Officer, Local Government   and   Rural   Development   Department,   Lahore   for redressal of her grievance. Respondent No.1 then instituted a revision petition which was allowed and divorce certificate dated 17.11.2012 was set aside vide order dated 31.10.2013 passed by respondent 2 which is under challenge in this writ petition.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5.       Learned counsel for the petitioner inter alia contends that under Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (the Ordinance), no appeal or revision is provided, hence respondent No.2 wrongly assumed his jurisdiction; that respondent No.2 has failed to appreciate that inspite of non-compliance of mandatory requirements of Section 7 of the Ordinance, the divorce is effective; that the petitioner divorced respondent No.1 on 21.10.2011 but the Secretary Union Council in collusion with respondent No.1 did not issue the divorce certificate; that despite repeated requests even after filing of petition by respondent No.1 before the Birmingham Court for dissolution of marriage, the divorce certificate was not issued; that when  the  Secretary  Union  Council  failed  to  issue  the  divorce\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\ncertificate after lapse of statutory period of 90 days, the petitioner approached this Court through a writ petition; that after issuance of direction by this Court, the divorce certificate was issued; that the stamps papers upon which the divorce deed was written were found correct by the SHO Police Station Islampura after due verification; that the impugned order is against law and fact; that respondent No.2 has no jurisdiction to deal with the matter in view of Section 7 of the Ordinance,  therefore,  this  writ  petition  be  allowed  and  impugned order dated 31.10.2013 be set aside.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6.       Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.1 has strongly opposed this writ petition and supported the impugned order. Learned counsel asserts that respondent No.2 had jurisdiction to deal with the matter who after perusal of record and in view of evidence led by the parties, has rightly set aside the divorce certificate as the proceedings before the Secretary Union Council were based on a forged and bogus divorce deed, never sent to the respondent-wife or to the Arbitration Council as alleged; that the petitioner participated in the proceedings before respondent No.2 without challenging his authority, as such, he is estopped by his conduct; that Administrator of Union Council did not constitute Arbitration Council as required under Section 7(4) of the Ordinance, as such, he had no authority or jurisdiction to deal with the matter; that there is no evidence that efforts for reconciliation of the parties were ever made during the said proceedings; that during the pendency of divorce proceedings before Birmingham Court, respondent No.3 had no lawful authority to conduct proceedings for issuance of  divorce certificate, therefore, this  writ  petition  has  no force, as such, it be dismissed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n7.       I have heard the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties and also perused the record.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n8.       The legal question raised by learned counsel for the petitioner is that this Court erred in law while holding that the respondent lady had remedy  before  the  Inspecting  Officer  under  the  Punjab  Local\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nGovernment   Ordinance,   1979   against   divorce   certificate   dated\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n17.11.2012  on  the  basis  of  alleged  forged  divorce  deed  dated\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n21.10.2011; that the said law was not applicable at the relevant time and that respondent No.2/Assistant Director, Local Government and Rural  Development, Lahore  (Inspecting  Officer)  who  declared  the divorce certificate null and void had no authority to deal with the matter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n9.       According to the petitioner, he divorced respondent No.1 vide divorce  deed  dated  21.10.2011  with  a  copy  of  the  same  to  the Secretary Union Council at that time but the divorce certificate was issued on 17.11.2012 after a direction made by this Court in Writ Petition  No. 27798/12 vide order dated 08.11.2012  which  divorce certificate was ultimately declared illegal vide impugned order.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n10.     Scanning  of  record  reveals  that  respondent  No.1  filed  Writ Petition No. 27798/12 challenging validity of the divorce certificate dated   17.11.2012   issued   on   the   basis   of   divorce   deed   dated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21.10.2011. The learned Judge while relying on the law laid down in case titled ‘àussain Bakhsh Khan Vs. Deputy Commissioner D.G. Khan and others (1999 CLC 88) held that the Inspecting Officer/respondent No.2 under the Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 1979 had authority to call for and inspect the bogus and fictitious record in possession of the Chairman of the Union Council, therefore, the writ petition was not maintainable. With due respect to the Hon”¢le Judge, I am of the view that since the matter pertained to the years 2011 and 2012, relevant law applicable to the case was Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 2001 and not the Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 1979. I have gone through the Punjab  Local Government Ordinance 2001 but remained unsuccessful to find out any provision therein giving authority to respondent No.2 to look into the genuineness or otherwise of a divorce certificate. In my view, there is no express provision in the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1961  or  in  the  Local  Government  Ordinance,  2001  by which  the issuance of certificate of talaq could be challenged. But at the same\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\ntime, I am of the view that there is no specific provision in the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 which empowers the Chairman Arbitration Council to issue any certificate in this regard.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n11.     Subsequent to the said order passed by learned Single Judge, respondent No.1 filed a revision petition before respondent No.2/Assistant Director Local Government with the allegation that the certificate of talaq dated 17.11.2012 issued on the basis of divorce deed dated  21.10.2011  was  bogus. The petitioner appeared before respondent No.2 and contested the revision petition of the respondent No.1. The respondent No.2 after recording statements of the parties, perusing the record and hearing both sides set aside the divorce certificate dated 17.11.2012. It is an admitted fact that the petitioner participated in the proceedings before respondent No.2 without objecting to his authority and has only raised such objection when the decision  came  against  him.  As  such,  he  is  estopped  by  his  own conduct to challenge the proceedings conducted by respondent No.2.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n12.     Report and parawise comments were called from respondent\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNo.2. Relevant paragraph of the comments is reproduced below:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n‘ân divorce cases the procedure provided under Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 is adopted. The Respondent No.1 stated that he sent original divorce paper to his  wife  and  copy  thereof  to  concerned  Union  Council. Whereas it transpired from the record that the Attorney of Respondent No.1 gave an application to the Union Council on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19.07.2012  alongwith  a  photocopy  of  divorce  deed  and  he stated that his son has divorced his wife and have already sent a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncopy to  Union  Council, therefore on the basis of that  copy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndivorce certificate might be issued. But it was confirmed by Respondent  No.4,  Secretary  Union  Council  No.37,  that  no notice of Talaq was ever received before subject application dated 19.7.2012 and he initiated proceedings on basis of that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n app li cat ion /ph ot ocopy.‘†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis provided)\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nIn the inquiry held by respondent No.2, it was established that no notice of talaq, in original, was ever received by the Secretary Union Council  No.37  prior  to  application  dated  19.07.2012.  The  said\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\napplication was filed subsequent to the petition filed by the respondent\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNo.1 before the court of Birmingham.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n13.     The stance of the petitioner is also belied by a document i.e. special power of attorney executed by the petitioner in favour of his father on 31.05.2012, which has been appended with this writ petition by the petitioner himself, wherein the petitioner has given powers to his father to institute a suit for restitution of conjugal rights against the present respondent No.1.  Relevant paragraphs of special power of attorney dated 31.05.2012 are reproduced below:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n”®1)   To file a suit on my behalf for restitution of conjugal rights against my wife Kalsoom Zubair daughter of Muhammad Tufail, resident of House No.II-B, Street No.16-C, Aziz Park, Mehmood Booti, Baghbanpura, Lahore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(2)  To serve her in the suit in any manner whatsoever as court  may direct  and  he  has  to  bear all  the  expenses regarding the above mentioned suit on my behalf and any other suits if filed by my wife.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(3) To defend any suit if my wife Kalsoom Zubair filed regarding dissolution of marriage, recovery of dowry amount, dowry articles, maintenance, etc. and any other suit if filed by her in any court of law.‘ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n14.     It is pertinent to note that the special power of attorney was executed by the petitioner in favour of his father on 31.05.2012 giving him authority to file a suit on his behalf for restitution of conjugal rights and also to contest the suit for dissolution of marriage if filed by the respondent No.1. This clearly shows that at least, till that time, there was no divorce by the petitioner to the respondent No.1. Had the petitioner sent divorce deed dated 21.10.2011 to respondent No.1 and the Secretary Union Council, he would have not asked his father to file a suit for restitution of conjugal rights  or contest the suit for dissolution of marriage if filed by the respondent No.1 on 31.05.2012 when the special power of attorney was executed by him in favour of his father. Meaning thereby the marriage was intact at least at the time when the said power of attorney was singed on 31.05.2012.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n15.     Furthermore, a person who wishes to approach the court for some relief must come to the court with clean hands. The petitioner while instituting the writ petition has failed to bring on record the proceedings conducted by respondent No.2 but has appended only the impugned order. The impugned order clearly depicts that the same was passed after hearing the parties and recording the statements of the parties but no such record has been produced before this court by the petitioner which shows mala fide on the part of the petitioner. In the circumstances, this writ petition is liable to be dismissed on this score alone.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n16.     In view of the discussion made in the preceding paragraphs, it is   unambiguously   clear   that   no   notice   of   talaq/divorce   deed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21.10.2011 was ever served by the petitioner upon the respondent nor any copy thereof was supplied to the Secretary Union Council, as such, the claim of petitioner to this extent is false and the divorce deed dated 21.10.2011 is result of fraud and forgery. In my firm view, a court cannot be used for protection of gains gotton by someone illegally,  unlawfully  and  fraudulently.  Even  if  an  order  has  been passed without jurisdiction but it advances the cause of justice, the court should not interfere therewith as neither any fraud and forgery committed by anyone should come in the way of justice nor writ jurisdiction can be invoked in aid of injustice. When the impugned order dated 31.10.2013 passed by respondent No2/Inspecting Officer/Assistant Director, Local Government and Rural Development Department, Lahore advances the cause of justice and sets aside the document which was obtained through fraud and forgery, the same cannot be set aside. Respectful reliance is placed on the dictums laid down by the Hon”¢le Supreme Court of Pakistan in cases reported ‘îhe    Chief    Settlement    Commissioner,    Lahore    Vs.    Raja\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Muha mma d  Fa zil  Kha n  a nd  o thers  (PLD  1 9 75  SC   33 10)‘† and\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ”†Ms t.   Sha hi da   a nd   a no ther   Vs .

In a nutshell, the divorce deed dated 21.10.2011 as well as divorce certificate dated 17.11.2012 are result of fraud and forgery which cannot be protected by this Court. As a result, this writ petition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis without any force.

Learned counsel for respondents\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNo.2 and 3 i.e. counsel representing judgment debtors has sent written request for adjournment on the ground that he is out of city   for   some   personal   emergency.   Learned   counsel   for respondent No.1 has prayed for hearing the arguments and stated that even a warning was  issued to respondents  No.2 and 3 to appear  in  person  but  neither  they  are  present  nor any one is present  to  represent  them.  Learned  counsel further stated  that these  respondents   are  in  league  with  the  appellant.  At  this juncture, learned counsel for the appellant states that he is ready to argue the case, as respondent No.1 is contesting respondent. As the appellant and respondent No.1 are contesting parties and request for adjournment sent by learned counsel for respondents No.2 and 3 is not appreciable, therefore I feel better to hear the contesting parties and decide the appeal.\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n2.                 Through  this  appeal,  appellant  has  challenged  the order dated 12.04.2011 passed by learned Addl: District Judge, Lahore, whereby in execution of a money decree filed by respondent No.1 the objection petition filed by the appellant has been dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.                 Learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  argues  that  the appellant  purchased  the  suit  plot  through registered  sale deed registered  on  03.01.2006  from  Mst.  Razia  Begum and  he has constructed a house and is residing therein; that no one informed the appellant  about any litigation  with regard  to the suit house nor any litigation was in the knowledge of appellant; that no one has resisted when he has raised construction over the suit plot; that as per knowledge of appellant neither the property was mortgaged nor attached in any proceedings of the suit; that when the proceedings  of attachment of property were initiated by the learned Executing Court, he came to know about the pendency of execution   petition,   therefore   he  has  filed  objection  petition before the trial court. Further states that learned Executing Court without framing any issue and inviting the parties to produce evidence  has  summarily  dismissed  the  application;  that  there were  many  questions  of  law  as  well as  fact  involved  in  the objection petition and the impugned order passed by learned Executing   Court   without   framing   the   issue   and   receiving evidence, is nullity in the eye of law. Learned counsel prays for\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nacceptance  of  this  appeal  and  remand  of the case to  learned\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nExecuting Court.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n4.                 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.1/decree  holder  states  that  even he has  filed  the complete documents with CM No.2-2012 and interim order sheet; that previously   respondent   No.1/decree   holder   filed   a   suit   for permanent injunction against Mst. Razia Begum/respondent No.3 in Civil Court, whereby the stay order was granted and during the stay order property was sold to the appellant; that afterwards the  said  suit  was  dismissed   for  non  prosecution;  that  the impugned order passed by learned Executing Court whereby the objection petition has been dismissed, is in accordance with law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.                 I have heard  the learned counsel for the parties  at length and gone through the record appended by learned counsel for the parties with this appeal as well as the impugned order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.                 Though learned counsel for the parties have tried to go  into  the  minute  details  of  facts  as  well as  law  applicable therein. I have noticed that both the parties have produced voluminous  documents  with  this  appeal  to  substantiate  their claim. So far as the objection of respondent No.1 and findings of learned Executing Court that the objection petition has been filed under wrong provision of law are concerned,  I am clear in my mind that when the application has been filed before the proper forum, mentioning of wrong provision of law does not make any difference,  as it is settled that citing the wrong provision of law\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nat the caption of suit/petition does not bar the court to exercise jurisdiction vested in it by law under the right provision of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.                 So far as the facts of case as well as law applicable thereto are concerned, it is also settled that law is applied on the basis of burden of facts admitted between the parties or proved by  the  parties.  In this  case,  the facts  of case are not simple, therefore  the  same  require  evidence  and  then  the  law  can be applied upon those facts. Therefore, I refrain myself from discussing  in detail the facts and documents  annexed  with this appeal, so that no one should be prejudiced . As in my view the proper course for determination of lis is to remand the case to the learned  Executing  Court  to  decide  the  same  after  framing  of issues and recording the evidence of parties.

During trial, through an application  dated  28.03.2014,  the  petitioner  prayed for sending his admitted signatures and cheque in dispute to the Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for comparison of his signatures, on the ground that he had not issued the cheque in dispute rather the complainant had stolen his cheque book and had forged his signatures on the cheque in dispute. The said application did not find favour with the learned trial court, which was dismissed vide order dated 05.04.2014. The petitioner, then preferred a criminal revision petition to assail the said order, which also failed as the same was dismissed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Taxila, vide order dated 17.04.2014. It is\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nin this background that the petitioner has preferred the instant petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.              It appears that what prevailed upon the learned trial court to dismiss the application of the petitioner was as under:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘ât reveals that previously the same prayer was put forth by the accused before the learned Justice of Peace/Additional Sessions Judge Taxila through his petition under section 22-A, 22-B, Cr.P.C. but the same was not granted. The accused has  not  challenged  the  said  order  before  any forum. Anyhow, without being indulged into the technicalities, it is crystal clear that the prosecution evidence has already been recorded in toto and the defence taken by the accused has unambiguously come on record through the cross examination conducted by him upon the prosecution witnesses. Moreover, Article 84 of Qanun-e- Shahadat  Order,  1984  empowers  the  court  to make comparison so even if the prayer of the accused is granted and an expert opinion is invited the same shall obviously be not binding upon the court. It means to say that there is no need to get the impugned signatures/handwriting compared as prayed for and it would just hinder the conclusion of trial.‘ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere  is  no  denial  of  the  fact  that  the  petitioner,  on\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n16.12.2013, had submitted an application under Section\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n22-A/22-B, Cr.P.C. for direction to the police concerned to get verified the signatures of  the petitioner on the said disputed  cheque  from  Forensic  Science  Agency,  Lahore and  that  the  said  application  was  dismissed  by  the learned Justice of Peace vide order dated 20.12.2013 with the following observation:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Ürom the perusal of record, it reflects that the FIR has already been registered u/s 489-F PPC. Since pertaining to occurrence, FIR had already been registered, therefore, no direction can be issued for verification of any signatures from FSL. However,  Investigation  Officer  of  the  case  is\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\ndirected   to   investigate   the   case   properly   in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccordance with law. This petition is disposed of. Copy of this order be sent to the SHO concerned for information and compliance.‘ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt appears that the challan in this case was forwarded to the court by the SHO on 18.12.2013, thus, it was for the learned trial court to see as to whether the cheque in dispute was liable to be sent to the Forensic Science Agency, Lahore alongwith admitted signatures of the petitioner, hence, the learned Justice of  Peace  was not proper forum for making such an application. It also appears that the petitioner, when applied for grant of bail before this Court by filing Crl. Misc. No.298/B of 2014, had also submitted CM No.173/M of 2014 with the following prayer:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘îherefore, it is earnestly prayed that it will be in all fairness and in the interest of justice that the I.O. may be directed to get the writing and signatures of petitioner on the cheque in question be verified from the handwriting expert for just decision of bail application.‘ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYet another CM bearing No.220/M of 2014 was also filed, which was disposed of by this Court on 25.03.2014 with the following observation:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘îhe   scope   of   a  petition   moved   under   the provisions of Section 497, Cr.P.C. is either to grant the bail to the petitioner or refuse it and in the petition, moved, as such, no interim relief over and above to the main and ultimate relief is legally possible. The request prayed for in Criminal Miscellaneous No.173/M of 2014 is nothing but would amount either to interference in the investigation of a criminal case or to pre-empt the jurisdiction of the learned trial court. Since the trial is underway, therefore, the petitioner would be at liberty to move the trial court for having such relief as prayed for here, if permissible under the law. The relief, which could not have been granted finally in proceeding, cannot be asked for\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nby   means   of   some  miscellaneous   and   interim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproceedings.‘ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is also borne out from the record that learned counsel for the petitioner had suggested  the complainant,  while he was under cross-examination, being P.W.1, during trial of the case, as under:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘ât is incorrect to suggest that the entry as well as signatures upon the impugned cheque Ex.P.C. is fake and fabricated. I have got no objection if the entries or signatures of Ex.P.C. are got examined from the FORENSIC Lab.‘ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSimilarly, the Investigation Officer of the case, namely Majeed  Ahmad  S.I.,  while  appearing  as  P.W.3  stated during cross examination as under:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘â  recorded  the  statement  of  the  accused  on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.12.2013. It is correct that in his statement recorded  by  me,  it  has  been  claimed  by  the accused that he did never issue any cheque to the complainant nor stood surety for any of his obligation. It is correct that he did also take the version that the FIR was lodged on the basis of fabrication.‘ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n3.              The above circumstances clearly suggest that the petitioner from the day one, has been agitating that the cheque in dispute was not issued by him and that the same was a forged document. In this view of the matter, it was incumbent upon the Investigation Officer to have secured the admitted signatures of the petitioner and then to send the cheque in dispute alongwith admitted signatures to the Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for comparison of the signatures in order to arrive at truth, but for the reasons best known to him, needful was not done. The petitioner was also unsuccessful before the learned Justice of Peace in this regard obviously for the reason that the matter, at that time, was before the learned trial court.  This  Court has  also  observed  in  its  order  dated\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n25.03.2014,  passed  in  CM  No.220/M of  2014  that the petitioner was at liberty to move the learned trial court for having such relief in the said application, if permissible under the law, but the learned trial court dismissed his application. It appears that what found favour with the learned trial court to dismiss the said application was dismissal of earlier application of the petitioner by the learned Justice of Peace, which had no significance, as it was the job of the learned trial court to send the document for comparison by the Finger Print Expert. Similarly, conclusion of prosecution evidence was also no ground to refuse sending the cheque in dispute to the Finger Print Expert for comparison of signatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.              Another   reason,   which   prevailed   upon   the learned  trial  court  to  dismiss  the  application  of  the petitioner was that the prosecution evidence had already been recorded in toto.   To my mind, this was also no a valid ground to refuse to send the disputed cheque for comparison to the Finger Print Expert, because FIR in this case, was registered on 11.12.2013, and the application was moved on 28.03.2014, as such it could not be said that the trial was lingering on for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.              As regards the power of the learned trial court to itself compare the cheque in dispute with the admitted signatures of the complainant, as envisaged under Article\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n84 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, to my mind, the said provision also does not debar the learned trial court from sending the cheque in dispute for comparison to the Finger Print Expert. The expert evidence is admissible in evidence  under  Article  59  of  Qanun-e-Shahadat  Order,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1984, and if such an evidence is not available, only then, the leaned trial court may itself compare the cheque with the  admitted  signatures  of  the  petitioner.  It  has  been\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nobserved in the  case  titled ‘ìohbat Ali Vs. Muhammad Alam‘†(PLD 2012 SC (AJ & K) 1), that the court in order to form an  opinion  may  seek  assistance from an  expert”≥ opinion, the relevant portion whereof reads as under:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Å perusal of Article leaves no doubt that when the Court has to form an opinion upon the identity of finger print impression, the opinions of the persons ‘•xperts in such fields‘†are relevant. The expert witness is one who has devoted time and study to a special branch of learning and thus is specially  skilled  on  the  points  is  admissible  to enable the court to come to a satisfactory conclusion.‘ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn another case titled ‘çuhammad Kabeer ud Din Vs. Muhammad Munir ud Din‘†(1993 CLC 747). It has been observed as under:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n”±1.   One of the scientific modes of proving a disputed signature is to refer it to a handwriting expert with admitted signature for his opinion. It was open to the appellant to apply for examination of disputed and admitted signatures to handwriting expert. This step has not been taken by him although from 1972 when the appellant filed suit No.1006/72 Muniruddin had denied the execution of the agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.     No doubt the Court is competent to compare the disputed and admitted signatures to ascertain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe genuineness of the disputed signature but such procedure is risky and has to be adopted with caution and sparingly. In the present case the volume of evidence is against the appellant”≥ contention.  The  mode  provided  under  law  for proving disputed signatures has not fully been adopted by the appellant, therefore, in these circumstances,  it will not be a safe course for the Court to compare the signatures and give a finding on it.‘ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThus, in the above circumstances, when the expert”≥ evidence can be procured with regard to the signatures on the  cheque  in  dispute,  there  appears  no  reason  why should the court take it on its own shoulder to make an\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nobservation regarding comparison of the disputed signatures with the disputed signatures of the petitioner. Needless to mention that ultimate decision has to be given by the learned  trial court keeping in view the pro and contra evidence of the parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.              It is also worth-mentioning here that an accused is  entitled  to  fair  trial  more  particularly  in  view of  the newly  inserted  Article  10-A  of  the  Constitution  of  the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The denial on the part of the learned trial court to send the cheque in dispute to the Finger Print Expert,  to  my mind, is violative of  the provisions of the said Article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.              In the light of above discussion, I have arrived at an irresistible conclusion that the learned trial court as also learned first appellate court have failed to exercise their jurisdiction, vested in them under the law and they have illegally dismissed the application, submitted by the petitioner. The instant petition is, therefore,  allowed and the impugned orders are hereby set aside. The application dated   28.03.2014,   submitted   by   the   petitioner,   is, therefore, allowed and the learned trial court is directed to secure the admitted signatures of the petitioner and then forward the said signatures alongwith cheque in dispute to the Forensic Science Agency, Lahore for comparison of the signatures and then to proceed with the matter strictly in accordance with law.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n(ARSHAD MAHMOOD TABASSUM) Judge\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAPPROVED FOR REPORTING\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nJudge\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJamshaid Kasuri\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'PLD 2012 Lahore 515, PLD 1997 Supreme Court 426, PLD 1989 Supreme Court 166, PLD 2012 Supreme Court 292, 369 US 186 (1962), AIR 1977 SC 1361');

Briefly the facts, as narrated in the petition, are that the petitioner  is  the  complainant  of  case  FIR  No.148  dated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.2.2014, u/s 496-A PPC registered at P.S B-Division, Sheikhupura wherein it  was alleged that  Mst. Sabiha, the daughter of his sister, was abducted by Muhammad Shan son of Muhammad Shafi on 26.1.2014 who was already married to  one  Sarfaraz.     During  the  investigation,  the  alleged abductee herself claimed that she had contracted marriage with Shan, with her own free will and consent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.        The petitioner moved a petition u/s 22(a)/22(b) Cr.P.C to the learned Justice of Peace for issuance of a direction, which was decided on 3.3.2014.   The direction issued by learned Justice of Peace is reproduced as under: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Ås per contents of petition, the instant petition stands disposed of with the direction to the I.O of aforesaid criminal case to investigate the case in hand on this line\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nas well that whether any offence alleged by the petitioner is committed by the alleged abductee by contracting her second marriage in existence of her first marriage and relevant offences be added by the I.O after conducting of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfair investigation.‘ç\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nStatedly, on non-compliance of the above referred direction, the petitioner filed another petition before the learned Justice of Peace on 12.3.2014, wherein another direction was issued on 28.03.2014, which is also reproduced as under: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘îhe   Investigating   officer   of   already registered criminal case bearing FIR No.148/2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU/S 496-A, PPC, P.S. B-Division, Sheikhupura is present in person before this court today.   He is directed to record the statement of petitioner with regard to the allegation that proposed accused was already in marital bond when she contracted second marriage and add other offences after investigation  in  fair  and  transparent manner in accordance with law, if contention of the petitioner is found true.   With the same observation the instant petition stands disposed of accordingly.  A copy of this petition and order be sent to SHO concerned. ”ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen, statedly the order dated 28.3.2014 was not implemented by the respondents, the petitioner filed the third petition and the learned Justice of Peace again issued a direction on 02.04.2014, which is also reproduced as under: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘ìince the aforesaid allegation has been leveled against the Investigating officer, Nishan Ali ASI,\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nPolice Station City B-Division, Sheikhupura, therefore, the matter is referred to the D.P.O Sheikhupura for probing into the same and for taking necessary legal action if any lapse is found on  the  part  of  the  said  police  officer.     The grievance of the petitioner also be redressed in accordance with law.  With the same observation the  instant  petition  stands  disposed  of accordingly‘Æ\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n4.        Now the petitioner has filed the instant writ petition with the prayer that;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(i)	‘¥his petition may kindly be accepted and the respondent	No.2   and   3   may   kindly   be summoned in person in this Court and questioned about their willful and deliberate repeated violation of the orders of the learned Justice of Peace and;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(ii)		they be directed to produce compliance report in this Court, by adding necessary sections in above FIR of petitioner and to act strictly in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccordance with law‘Æ\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nIn view of the prayer, made by the petitioner to this Court, I find it necessary to dilate upon the legality of both the parts of his prayer one by one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.        As far as the violation of the orders of the learned Justice of Peace is concerned, I am of the view that no doubt, the remedy is, invoking the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court, but it is very much relevant in the circumstances of the case that this Court should interfere and come forward in case\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nthe orders passed by learned Justice of Peace are legally valid and if orders are otherwise, neither the government functionaries are bound to obey such orders nor this Court should interfere in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction. Even  otherwise,  constitutional  jurisdiction  of  High  Court being discretionary in character needs to be exercised after proper application of mind with cogent reasons and not arbitrarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.        The second part of the prayer contains the compliance of  the  orders  of  the  learned  Justice  of  Peace  regarding insertion of applicable sections in the FIR.   Regarding the legality of this part of the prayer, law is very much clear. Under the provisions of Section 9 (7) of Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions & Power) Act,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2006, the District Prosecutor has the powers to scrutinize the available evidence and applicability of offences against all or any of the accused as per facts and circumstances of the case. Deletion or insertion of any offence falls within the exclusive domain of the investigating police agency and District Prosecutor.    Question whether the police or District Prosecutor had rightly deleted or inserted the sections, is to be seen by the learned trial court at the time of framing of the charge and such act by the investigating agency or the District Prosecutor cannot be challenged either u/s 22-a/22-b, Cr.P.C or  under  constitutional jurisdiction of  High  Court,  as  this\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nwould amount to the interference in the investigation.  In this regard, guidance is  sought from landmark judgment titled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘ãhizar Hayat vs. Inspector General of Police (Punjab), Lahore and others (PLD 2005 Lahore 470), the relevant paragraph is reproduced as under: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n”®x)  Complaints  about  failure  by  an  investigating officer to add appropriate penal provisions to an FIR or a cross-version of the accused party:- Such complaints are not worthy of being taken with any degree of seriousness by an ex-officio Justice of the Peace.  The stands taken by the complaining persons in this regard normally touch the merits of the allegations  and  an  ex-officio  Justice  of  the  Peace would be well advised to refrain from entering into any such controversy at a premature stage.   The overall incharge of a criminal case is the Area Magistrate who, even during the progress of an investigation, gets many opportunities to go through the record of investigation conducted by the police and in an appropriate case and at an appropriate stage he can require the investigating officer to consider addition or deletion of any, penal provision.  After submission of a report under section 173, Cr.P.C./Challan the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence or the trial Court taking cognizance of the case can take cognizance of any offence disclosed by the material available on the record of investigation even if the police have not invoked the relevant penal provision. Even at the time of framing of the charge a trail Court can frame a charge in respect of any offence disclosed by the record even if the same finds no mention in the report submitted under section 173, Cr.P.C/Challan.\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nWith so many opportunities being available with the Magistrate and the trial Court regarding rectification of a mistake, deliberate or otherwise, committed by the police in this connection it would be unwise for an exofficio Justice of the Peace to interfere with such a matter at an inappropriate and premature stage. In case  of  receipt  of  such  a  complaint  an  ex-officio Justice  of  the  Peace  may  advise  the  complaining person to approach the Area Magistrate or the trial Court, as the case may be, rather than entertaining such a complaint himself‘Æ\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n7.         Another important aspect of this case is that the I.O has already submitted a report dated 01.04.2014 before the learned Justice of Peace, mentioned in paragraph No.6 of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwrit petition wherein it is recorded that after obtaining the\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nlegal opinion, the offences u/s 494/496-B, PPC are applicable\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwhich are non cognizable offences.  The cancellation report\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhas   already   been   prepared.      Even   according   to   the\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\npetitioner”≥ own stand during the investigation, the alleged offences committed are sections 494/496-B, PPC and not section 496-A, PPC.   Offences u/s 494/496-B, PPC are non cognizable, then how the FIR can remain in field?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what has been discussed above, I am of the considered view that not only the instant petition is misconceived but also the directions issued by the learned Justice of Peace to the extent of direction for insertion of certain penal provisions are not warranted by law and thus are\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nset aside.     Hence, this petition is dismissed in limine being misconceived as well as devoid of any force.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApproved for report.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJudge\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n* Rafaqat Ali\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'PLD 2013 SC 793, PLD 1952 Lahore 587, Rule 140 of the Pakistan Prison Rules 1978, 2013 SCMR 1572, PLD 2004 Lahore 199, 2007 SCMR 142, 2008 SCMR 1631, PLD 2007 SC 571, PLD 2009 SC 11, 2012 SCMR 59, PLD 2015 SC 50'),

Brief facts of the case are that the petitioners filed a suit for recovery  of  maintenance,  maternity  expenses   (on  the  birth  of petitioner No.2), dower of Rs.200,000/-, a house, 13 ›†tolas gold and dowry articles worth Rs.3,82,441/-. The suit was contested. Issues were framed whereupon evidence of the parties was recorded. The learned trial Court partially decreed the suit, vide judgment and decree dated 13.04.2011 in the following terms:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n‘¥he maintenance allowance of minor plaintiff No.2 is fixed at the rate of Rs.5000/- (rupees five thousand only) per month from  the  date  of  institution  of  this  suit  with  10%  annual increase till further orders whereas the instant suit is hereby dismissed to the extent of recovery of maintenance allowance of plaintiff No.1. The instant suit to the extent of recovery of delivery expenses of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only), gold ornaments, deferred dower of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees two lacs only) and a house is also dismissed. However, the plaintiff No.1 is held entitled to the recovery of dowry articles as per list Ex.D-11.‘ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.       Feeling aggrieved, both the parties filed separate appeals. The learned lower Appellate Court dismissed both the appeals, with the modification in the judgment and decree of the trial Court to the effect that petitioner No.1/Mst. Nabeela Shaheen was also held entitled to the recovery of her maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.5,000/- per month. The petitioners being dissatisfied have now invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court by filing the instant writ petition.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.       Learned   counsel   for  the  petitioners,  Mrs.  Sarkar  Abbas, Advocate, at the very outset submitted that she does not press this petition  to  the  extent  of  claim of  maternity  expenses  incurred  by petitioner No.2 on the birth of petitioner No.1. Regarding rest of the claim the learned counsel  contended that the findings of both the courts  below  are  against  the  law  and  facts  on  the  record;  that judgments and decrees of both the courts below are based on surmises and conjectures; that both the courts have misread the evidence available on the record; that petitioner No.1 had brought strong evidence on the record to prove the contents of the nikahnama according to which an amount of Rs.200,000/-, 10 tolas gold and a house was fixed as dower but the same was misinterpreted by both the courts   below   and   illegally   turned   down   her   prayer;   that   the\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nmaintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.5000/- per month granted to petitioners is insufficient in this age of inflation. Moreover, petitioner No.2 is school going and also suffers from disease of asthama , as such, extra money is needed to cater for his requirements; that respondent is a UK national and earns a handsome amount and he is bound to maintain the petitioners according to his status and income;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5.       Conversely, it has been argued on behalf of the respondent that that maintenance allowance fixed by the Courts below does not commensurate with his source of income as he is jobless; that the learned lower appellate Court has illegally granted to petitioner No.1 the maintenance allowance which was rightly declined by the learned trial Court; that at the time of “Æikah“†only Rs.2000/- was fixed as prompt dower and the entries mentioned in column No. 14 of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Æikahnama“†are forged and fabricated and are result of manipulation with the connivance of the concerned Nikah Registrar; that petitioner No.1 was given 10 tolas gold ornaments by respondent at the time of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Æikah“†which are still with her; that there is no description of the house given in the “Æikahnama“ª that the dowry list appended with the plaint also contained such articles which were never given at the time of marriage and the receipts thereof produced by the petitioner were maneuvered later on.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6.       Arguments heard. Record perused.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n7.       Admittedly,  the  respondent  is  a  UK  national  ever  since his marriage with petitioner No.1. He has taken inconsistent pleas with regard to his source of income in his written statement and during the arguments addressed by his counsel before this Court. In the written\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nstatement he stated that he has no permanent source of income while it is argued by his learned counsel that he is jobless. But he has not been able to deny that he is getting sufficient subsistence allowance being a UK national. In the circumstances, when there is no evidence that petitioner No.1 has been living apart from her husband without any lawful excuse, she is entitled to get maintenance allowance as prayed for in her suit till the subsistence of marriage. Similarly, petitioner No.2, who is minor son of the respondent is a school going child. He being  a  patient  of  asthma  is  also  required  to  meet  considerable expense on his medication. In these circumstances, his maintenance fixed at the rate of Rs.5000/- per month seems to be insufficient to meet his requirements. This Court is, therefore, inclined to enhance his  rate  of  maintenance  from   Rs.5000/- to  Rs.10000/-  with  10% annual increase.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n8.       So far as the question of dower, a house and 10 tolas gold is concerned, the petitioner has produced evidence from which it can safely be inferred that at the time of marriage Rs.200,000/- was fixed as dower, in addition to 10 tolas gold and a house. The respondent”≥ own witness Zaheer Ahmed while appearing as D.W.2 admitted in his cross-examination admitted that an amount of Rs.200,000/- was fixed as dower. The respondent has failed to adduce any cogent evidence to rebut version of the petitioner. There is no weight in the arguments that   the   entries   in   the   “Æikahnama“†  have   been   interpolated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“éikahnama“†is a public document which is registered under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 and as such presumption of truth  is  attached  to  it.  According  to  law,  four  copies  of  the\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n“Æikahnama“† are  prepared,  out  of  which  one  is  kept  by  Nikah Registrar, second  is  sent  to  the concerned  Municipal  Corporation, Municipal Committee or Union Council, third copy is supplied to the bride and the fourth one is given to the bridegroom. The very object behind it is so that each party may verify the entries in the Nikahnama according to the terms of marriage settled between them. The “Æikah“†between the parties was solemnized on 19.8.2007, the suit was filed on 19.12.2009 and during the period from 19.8.2007 to 19.12.2009 and even thereafter the respondent did not bother to avail his remedy against the alleged interpolation in the “Æikahnama“Æ During the course of evidence he has equally failed to bring on any record any thing to prove that the entries in column No.14 were changed. In the case of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMuhammad Aslam v.  Mst. Suraya (PLD 2000 Lahore 355) it has\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nbeen held that if any party was of the view that Nikah Registrar had interpolated  in  the  entries  of  Nikah  Register,  such  party  could approach   the   Deputy   Commissioner   who   was   the   Controlling Authority and could get the same corrected. In the cited case it has also been held that transaction of dower would become complete on the day of marriage and that endorsement of dower against column in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Æikahnama“†was a verification of settlement and arrangement already reached between the parties. And that whenever a woman makes a demand through filing a suit for recovery of dower, the person who contends that the entries in Nikahnama are not correct is bound to rebut these entries through strong evidence otherwise the Courts are bound to give a solemn affirmation to the entries in Nikahnama. Keeping in view the evidence available on the record this Court is of the opinion that both the courts below have wrongly dismissed the suit\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nof   the   petitioner   qua   the   claim   regarding   dower   amount   of Rs.200,000/-, 10 tolas gold and a house. She was entitled to recover the same from the respondent as settled between the parties at the time of “Æikah“Æ No doubt description of the house is not mentioned in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Æikahnama“†but this fact is not fatal to the claim of the petitioner. In\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nthe case cited as  Dr. Asma Ali v. Masood Sajjad and others (NLR\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n2011  Civil  293)  wherein  no  description  of  land  was  given  in\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n“Æikahnama“†in terms of agricultural land”≥ khasra numbers or identifying data, Supreme Court directed the trial Court to appoint commission comprising of a member of Revenue hierarchy to determine  the  average  price of  per  kanal  of  agricultural  land  and thereafter wife was held entitled to receive as dower market value of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n100 kanals of agricultural land as determined. Seeking guidance from the cited judgment this Court is inclined to direct the District Officer (Revenue), Rawalpindi to inquire as to which one of the house at the time of marriage was owned by the respondent and what was its value. The market value so evaluated by the Revenue Authorities will be payable by the respondent to the petitioner No.1.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n9.       For what has been discussed above, the instant writ petition is\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\naccepted in the terms enumerated above.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nRafiq\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Muhammad Farrukh Irfan Khan) Judge\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nApproved for Reporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2010 SCMR 1125, 1997 SCMR 209, PLD 2010 SC 61, 2010 SCMR 322, 2014 SCMR 1334, 2013 SCMR 842'),

It is the case of the leaned counsel for the petitioner that this Court in FAO No.51/2013 arising from an of the order of Consumer Court vide order dated 09.06.2014 held that District Consumer Court lacked  jurisdiction in view of the Telecom Consumers Protection Regulations, 2009 whereas the case of respondent is that a conflicting judgment has been passed by this Court in F.A.O. No. 60/2009 wherein the complaint before the Consumer Court against the Telecommunication Company was held maintainable.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n4.       Arguments heard and record perused.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n5.       Before dealing with the case in hand, it is pertinent to point out that judgment passed by this Court in FAO No. 51/2013 and F.A.O. No. 60/2009 are not conflicting with each other. In F.A.O. No. 51/2013 it was held that in presence  of  Telecom  Consumers  Protection  Regulations,  2009,  which  is  a federal statute, a provincial statute i.e. Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 is not applicable, whereas, in F.A.O. No.60/2009 a complaint under Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 was filed in year 2006 before the promulgation of Telecom Consumers Protection Regulations, 2009, therefore it was held that Telecom Consumers Protection Regulations, 2009 will become applicable from the date of notification i.e. 06.04.2009 and cannot be applied retrospectively, and it was held that as the complaint filed in the year 2006 under the Punjab Consumer Protection, Act 2005 was maintainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.       In the case at hand, respondent No.2 has filed the complaint admittedly on 11.06.2012 whereby he prayed that action against the petitioner be taken under  the provisions of sections 28,31 & 32 of the Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 as the petitioner company is involved in sub-standard, low quality, faulty, defective services and by charging extra amount and making wrong addition and deduction from the account of the complainant as well as from the other consumers of the petitioner company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.       Admittedly petitioner company is a Telecommunication Company which is a federal subject and falls at item No.7 of the Federal Legislative. It is for this reason this Court while dealing with FAO No.51/2009 has held vide order dated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n09.06.2014 that Telecom Consumers Protection Regulations, 2009 presently holds the field and in case of any grievance with regard to Telecommunication\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nthe same will be dealt with under said Regulation. Regulation No.11 of the\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTelecom Consumers Protection Regulations, 2009, which states as under:-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n11.        Nature of  complaintsÿéotwithstanding anything contained in any procedures provided in any law for the time being in force, all Operators shall entertain complaints of Consumers in relation to any Service, including but not limited to the following issues:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(i)         Misuse of Service (ii)        Quality of Service (iii)       Illegal Practices\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(iv)       Poor Services\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(v)        Provision of Service (vi)        Misleading Statements (vii)      Non-Provision of Service\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(viii)     Mobile Number Portability related complaints\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n8.       The   contents   of   complaint   filed   before   the   Consumer   Court   by respondent No.2 clearly reveal that the same falls within the parameters mentioned  in  regulation  11  of  Telecom Consumers  Protection  Regulations,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2009. Regulation 15   whereof relates to procedure by which the complaints needed to be dealt with by the authority and also contains the action/powers which can be passed/imposed against the Telecommunication company as mentioned in Regulations No.15 (9) and (10) reproduced hereunder for ready reference:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(9)        In the event that a complaint filed under sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 15 reveals general deficiency or systemic inadequacy in the provision of Services adopted by the Operator, the Operator shall take remedial steps in respect of all Consumers and intimate the same to the Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(10)      Without prejudice to the forgoing the Authority may on its own, initiate appropriate action against the Operator, for any activity or activities directly or indirectly, adversely affecting the interests of the Consumers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n9.        It is not denied by any of the parties that Telecommunication Company falls within the ambit of Federal Laws, therefore, any legislation made by the Federal Government will prevail over the provincial statute. Hence, in presence of Telecom Consumers Protection Regulations, 2009, which have been made pursuant to clause (o) of sub-section (2) of Section 5 read with clause (c) and (m) of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organization) Act, 1996, being a\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nspecial law, the District Consumer Court has no jurisdiction to entertain complaint against the telecommunication company under the Punjab Consumer Protection Act,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2005 being a general law.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n10.      Even otherwise it is settled principal of interpretation of statute that provision of special law on a subject exclude the applicability of general law to such subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReference in this regard is made to the case reported as Inspector General of\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPolice Punjab Vs Mushtaq Ahmed Warraich (PLD 1985 SC 159).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n11.      For the facts and reasons enumerated above, order dated 22.9.2014 is hereby set aside. Consequently, the complaint filed by respondent before the Consumer Court Gujranwala is returned under Order VII Rule 10 CPC to the respondent for filing before the competent forum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.

According to brief facts of the case respondents- plaintiffs on 21.01.1996 filed a suit for declaration that they be declared allottees of Ihata No. 23 Abadkari measuring 2 Kanals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Marlas situated in Chak No. 100 Shumali, Tehsil & District\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSargodha  on  the  basis  of  orders  passed  by  the  Officer\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nAbadkari/Collector dated 7.7.1991 and order of Additional Commissioner (Revenue) Sargodha dated 20.9.1993. They have challenged  the  order  of  Member  Board  of  Revenue  dated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25.8.1994 whereby both the above said orders were set aside. Written statement was filed. Suit was contested. Issues were framed. Parties were invited to produce their respective evidence. Both the parties produced their oral as well as documentary evidence. After completion of trial vide judgment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n& decree dated 29.6.2004 learned trial court decreed the suit. Appeal was preferred by the petitioners, same was dismissed vide judgment & decree dated 21.7.2005. Hence, this civil revision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.                 Learned Additional Advocate General on behalf of the petitioners argues that order passed by the Member Board of Revenue is in accordance with law keeping in view all the facts and rules under the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act (V of 1912). States that learned trial court has ignored  the  evidence  produced  by the  petitioners-defendants and absolutely has not discussed the same whereas the documentary evidence in the shape of Exh. D.1 to Exh.D.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJamabandies for the year 1926-1927 have been produced and originally the land was admittedly allotted to the Canal Department for construction of Patwar Khana in the year 1922 and all the Jamabandies which have been produced as Exh.D.1 to Exh.D.5 clearly show that the land in dispute Ihata No. 23\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nwhich consists upon 2 Kanals 4 Marlas is recorded as Patwar Khana in the possession of Canal Department. This un-rebutted evidence has been ignored by the learned trial court, therefore, reached to a wrong conclusion. Further that even the order of the Board of Revenue, which was under challenge before the learned trial court has also not been looked into. In the order the relevant provisions of law have been referred and on the basis of the same, the order has been passed which is Exh.P.1 produced by the plaintiffs-respondents themselves. When it was noted that the order dated 7.7.1991 was passed by the Colony Assistant/Collector and further that no notice under section 24 of the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act (V of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1912) was issued to the Canal Department, the order was nullity in the eye of law. This being so the plaintiffs failed to rebut this fact noted by the Member Board of Revenue in his order and further that the learned first appellate court has wrongly held that appeal was filed after the prescribed period of limitation and further the learned appellate court has also not discussed the evidence and just validated the findings recorded by the learned trial court which are against the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.                 On the other hand, learned counsel representing respondents states that with regard to the condonation of delay there is no distinction with the ordinary person and the Government  and  further  that  the  order  of  Colony  Assistant dated 7.7.1991 is in accordance with law. Admits that no notice\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nhas been given under section 24 of the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act (V of 1912) to the petitioners- defendants department. When questioned to the learned counsel for the respondents that whether the Colony Assistant/Collector was competent to convert the nature of the land for construction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof Patwar Khana to the residential Ihata, he relies upon ‘éaseer\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAhmad versus Member, Board of Revenue and others‘†(1985\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMLD  1277).  Further  refers  the  statement  of  DW-1  Imam Bakhsh the only witness appeared on behalf of the defendants. States that the orders passed by both the courts below are in accordance with law and further that the defendants failed to prove that they have taken the possession in accordance with Section  10(4)  of  the  Colonization  of  Government  Lands (Punjab) Act (V of 1912), therefore, prays for dismissal of the revision petition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.                 I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the entire evidence and the findings recorded by both  the  courts  below  with  the  able  assistance  of  learned counsel for the parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.                 There are two questions involved in this litigation; first is whether the Colony Assistant/Collector was competent to cancel the land which was allotted to the Canal Department for construction of Patwar Khana in the year 1922 and further whether he was competent to change the nature of land and convert it into residential Ihata and further before cancellation\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nthe legal requirements have been complied with, the answer of both  the  questions  has  been  given  in  the  order  passed  by Member Board of Revenue dated 25.8.1994 under challenge in the suit. In para 8, he held as under:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Ås  District  Collector  vide  his  order  dated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19.8.1989 had clearly held that the impugned site  having  stood  reserved  for  Canal Department was not available for allotment to the present respondents and as the said order had not been challenged by them, CA/Collector was  certainly  not  competent  to  have subsequently allotted the same site to the respondents.     CA/Collector”≥     order     dated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.7.1991 and Additional Commissioner”≥ order dated 20.9.1993 are not sustainable and are set aside. Site No. 23 measuring 2 Kanals and 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarlas of Chak No. 100/NB, Tehsil and District Sargodha shall continue to stand reserved for Canal Patwarkhana.‘ç\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this view of the matter, when the order of District Collector dated 19.8.1989 was in the field and it was never challenged before any higher forum, the Colony Assistant/Collector was not competent to pass the order dated 7.7.1991 and same is the position of order of Additional Commission dated 20.9.1993. It is an admitted position that the land reserved for a specific purpose which was validated by the District Collector, subsequently the Colony Assistant/Collector has no authority to change the purpose of that land and convert the land which was reserved for construction of Patwar Khana for the Canal\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nDepartment and to convert it into a residential Ihata.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n7.                 So  far  as  objection  of  Section  10(4)  of  the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act (V of 1912) raised by the learned counsel for the respondents is concerned, the Government of Punjab has never denied the allotment of the land to the Canal Department and continuous possession which has  been  recorded  in  Exh.D.1  to  Exh.D.5  the  Jamabandies, which start from the year 1926-1927 of the Canal Department as Ihata No. 23 for construction of Patwar Khana. It is well settled law that the longstanding entries in the revenue record cannot  be  changed  except  in  accordance  with  law.   The plaintiffs-respondents could not produce any record to show that through any valid order the entry in the name of Canal Department  was  changed. The orders passed by the Colony Assistant/Collector as well as Additional Commissioner were against the record and also without jurisdiction, therefore, the same were set aside by the Member Board of Revenue through the order dated 25.8.1994. When the District Collector vide his order dated 19.8.1989 held that impugned site stood reserved for  Canal  Department,  the  revenue  record  also  supports  the same, in this eventuality the objection of section 10(4) of the Colonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act (V of 1912) raised by the respondents is not only factually incorrect but respondents have no right to raise this objection, therefore, objection raised by the respondents under section 10(4) of the\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nColonization of Government Lands (Punjab) Act (V of 1912) is repelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.                 In a suit for declaration the plaintiff is required to prove a case pleaded by him and he can get a decree with regard to a pre-existing right in his favour by proving his pleadings and his entitlement for the decree, through a declaratory decree a new right cannot be created. When the order of the Member Board of Revenue is on the basis of available revenue record and on the basis of existing law, same cannot be set aside without any justifiable reason. The reasons recorded by the learned trial court while setting aside the order impugned before it are not borne out from the record, specially he has ignored the documentary evidence produced by the defendants-petitioners as Exh.D.1 to Exh.D.5 and also ignored the law on the subject. When it is not denied by anyone that the land in dispute was allotted by the Government of Punjab to the Canal Department for construction of Patwar Khana in the year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1922 and the possession was given by the Government to the Canal  Department  for  construction  of  the  same,  which  is verified from the Jamabandies (Exh.D.1 to Exh.D.5) and entries of  the  Jamabandies  carry  the  presumption  of  correctness, though the presumption is ever rebuttable but if the same is not rebutted, the presumption is used in favour of the person in whose favour the entries are available. In this regard when the entries of allotment and possession are available in favour of Canal Department with regard to the suit property from 1922 to\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nonward and no valid entry substituting this entry has been produced or proved by the plaintiffs-respondents, therefore, the orders passed by the Colony Assistant/Collector as well as Additional Commissioner were against the record and were nullity in the eye of law, therefore, Member Board of Revenue vide his order dated 25.8.1994 has rightly set aside the same and the learned Civil Judge was having no evidence to set aside the order passed by the Member Board of Revenue. In this view of the matter, findings recorded by the learned trial court are not sustainable under the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.                 So  far  as  findings  of  the  learned  first  appellate court are concerned, on merits he has just affirmed the findings of the learned trial court which are not sustainable. The finding that  the  appeal  was  filed  after  the  prescribed  period  of limitation. The findings of the learned first appellate court are also  wrong  as  it  has  been  noted  by  the  learned  Additional District Judge that the judgment by the trial court was passed on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29.6.2004, certified copy was applied on 27.7.2004, same was delivered on 9.9.2004 and the appeal was filed on 11.9.2004. In this view of the matter, appeal seems to have been filed within the prescribed period of limitation. Learned first appellate court has not noted the date of preparation of the certified copies. It seems that note of the learned Additional District Judge that the appeal has been filed after the lapse of 2›†months, is against the record. Noting by the learned Additional District Judge with regard  to  the  date  of  decision  and  filing  of  application  for\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nissuance of certified copies and filing of appeal before the learned lower appellate court shows that appeal before it has been filed within the prescribed period of limitation. Even otherwise, if a certified copy is prepared after the proposed date of issue of certified copy given to an applicant under section\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12(2)  of  the  Limitation  Act,  1908,  the  Copying  Agency  is bound under the law to issue notice to the party for collection of certified  copies.  It  is  no  one”≥  case  that  the  copies  were prepared earlier and intentionally same were received with a delay. In this view of the matter, when the dates as mentioned supra noted by the learned first appellate court are considered, the appeal was within the prescribed period of limitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.               In this view of the matter, the case law referred by the learned counsel for the respondents is not applicable to the facts of this case and the findings recorded by both the courts below are against the record and they have set aside the order passed by the Member Board of Revenue, which is based upon evidence and record, therefore, this civil revision is accepted and the judgments and decrees passed by both the courts below are  set  aside,  suit  filed  by  the  plaintiffs-respondents  stand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndismissed. No order as to costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nMazhar*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nAPPROVED FOR REPORTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(AMIN-UD-DIN KHAN) JUDGE\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nJUDGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'PLD 2008 SC 400, PLD 2010 SC 745, Reference No.14 of 1996, PLD 1969 SC 278');

Respondent No.2  is  Additional   Director,  F  &  R, Punjab Health  Foundation  Lahore,  an organization which came  into  being  on  the  strength  of the  Punjab  Health\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   l 994  (hereinafter   called  as  Act,   1992).  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n?/   said Act was promulgated on 10th  of November,   1992 for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  establishment  of  the  Punjab  Health   Foundation  to\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\npromote  and finance  the development of the health sector in the Province of the Punjab. Section  10 of the Act, 1992 deals  with  the  functions   of the  Foundation   and  Section IO(l)(e) provides  to give loans to health  institutions.  The health  institutions   also  cover  the institutions  established under the Non-Government Organizations.\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWrit Petition No.l 1699 of2013                                                                                                2\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n3.      The  petitioner''s  NGO  applied  for loan  of Rs.12,00,000/- from respondent No.2 for construction  of hospital  over land measuring  09-kanals  11-marlas situated at  Mauza   Hajrai  Khurd   Tehsil  Pattoki   District   Kasur, which  was  accordingly  allowed  to the said NGO  against an agreement  executed  between  the petitioner  and respondent   No.2.      Respondent   No.2,   at  the   time   of execution  of loan agreement, obtained  sixteen cheques  as security  of loan  from  the petitioner @ Rs.75,000/-  each with  the  promise   that  on  deposit   of each  installment, respective  cheques would be given back to her.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.        The contention  of the petitioner  is that she has been paying the installments  but respondent  No.2 submitted an application  before  respondent   No.3  with  the  allegation that three  cheques  bearing  No.630379061,  63037908  and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n63037911 were dishonoured  on their presentation.  Further that  on  the  application   of respondent   No.2,  respondent No.I, Inspector  General of Police, Punjab  directed CCPO, Lahore to take necessary  legal action against the petitioner by  way  of  lodging   an  FIR.  The  said  letter  has  been impugned  by the petitioner  in the  instant writ petition  by contending   that  the  loan  is  secured  by  mortgaging   the precious land of the petitioner;  that  respondent  No.2  can only   invoke   jurisdiction   of  the   competent    Court   to determine  the  liability  of the petitioner and then proceed in  accordance with  law.  Further  that  the  police  has  no lawful  authority  to interfere  into the matter which purely is of civil nature.  It is further contended  that the cheques were  given  to respondent No.2  as security  and the same were not issued against any obligation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5.         The  learned  Assistant   Advocate   General,  Punjab entered   appearance   on  behalf   of  the  respondents   and submitted   before  this  Court  brief  history   of the  case pertaining    to   the   loan   given   by   the   Punjab   Health\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                \r\n\r\n◊¢''\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWrit Petition No. l 1699 of 2013                                                                                                               3\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFoundation to the petitioner.  After perusal of the same, it transpired that  recovery  of loan  is to be made  in sixteen installments@ Rs.75,000/-  each as mentioned  in the brief history,  whereby  the  loanee has to pay the 6th installment on  the due  date.  Show  cause  notices  were  issued  to the loanee  for the deposit  of installments  but in vain.  As the advance  cheques  were  dishonoured,  therefore, the police\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.department  was  approached for  lodging  the  FIR against\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nthe  loanee   considering   the  dishonour   of cheques   as  a criminal  act  on her  part.  Subsequent  to  the  show  cause notices,    the   loanee    approached    the   foundation    and promised  to pay the forthcoming  installment  on due date. Learned  Assistant  Advocate  General  Punjab has  further contended  that  the  loanee  has  paid   1 ith  installment  on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.02.2014 and still she is defaulter of7 to 11  installments\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nand surcharge  @ 4% per month.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n6.       The  petitioner   has. also  provided   a copy  of loan agreement executed  between her and respondent No.2 and has drawn the attention  of this Court towards clauses  3, 9 and 12 of the agreement,  which are reproduced  below.-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nClause (3). before the release of land the borrower shall execute a registered mortgage deed of immoveable property  on prescribed  format or provide  bank guarantee  or  Government security to the satisfaction  of the Foundation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n◊†    Clause  (9)  if  the  loan  is  not  repaid   according  to  the  . repayment   schedule,   the  borrower   will   be liable  to pay  a penalty  of 4% per  month  on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      the defaulted amount.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nClause  (12)?  If the  borrower  commits  a  breach  of any clause  of this  agreement  the  creditor  may issue  show  cause notice  to the  borrower  to pay the loan immediately alongwith  penalty.\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe  creditor  is  also  at  liberty  to  take  any legal action to recover the loan  and penalty, if any, which may include legal notice, publication  in  newspaper  and  sale  of the mortgaged property OR invoke the Bank Guarantee  OR  as  arrears  of land  revenue under the Revenue Recovery Act, 1890\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n7.       I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the  petitioner   as  well  as  learned  Assistant  Advocate General and have gone through the material available on the record.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n8.       The     criminal     action    proposed     entails    the punishment  contained  in  Section  489-F  of the  Pakistan Penal  Code,  1860  for dishonestly  issuing  a cheque and maximum   punishment   whereof  is   three   years.   This Section   was   introduced   and   inserted   by   Ordinance LXXXV  of 2002 dated 25.10.2002. The said Section was inserted  in the Pakistan  Penal Code,  1860 to punish the delinquents having  dishonestly  issued a cheque towards repayment of loan or fulfillment of an obligation  which is dishonoured  on its presentation.  This Section  could only be invoked where the cheque has been deliberately issued with an intention to defraud the payee with criminal intention.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n9.       Now adverting to the terms and conditions of the loan agreement referred  to above,  it transpires that other than deposit of cheque as security, the loan was secured by  way of mortgage deed dated 24.03.2007 executed by the  petitioner  in  favour  of  respondent  No.2  before. the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Sub-Registrar    Pattoki,    District    Kasur    against    land measuring  9-Kanals  11-Marlas  bearing  Khewat No.738,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKhetoni  No.2143  to 2145, Qita No.3 situated  at Mauza\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHanjrai Khurd Tehsil Pattoki District Kasur.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n10.     The   assertion   of  learned   Assistant   Advocate General  Punjab  that police department was approached for lodging of FIR  against the  loanee  considering  the dishonour of cheque as a criminal act on her part,  is not correct.  When  a  loan  has  been  granted  and  same  is secured by way of mortgage deed against valuable immoveable property  and that  too  in  the  presence of clause (12)  of above referred agreement, same cannot be recovered  by  way  of exercising coercive measures  as mentioned in the loan agreement. There is  a procedure provided in the said clause that the recovery of loan could be effected by resorting to the provisions of the Revenue Recovery Act, 1890.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n11.     This  is  an admitted fact that the  Punjab  Health Foundation does not come within the purview of financial institution as provided in the Financial Institutions (Recovery  of Finances Ordinance), 2001   but being an organization empowered to extend loans could be equated with the status of financial institution which is creation of statute i.e. Punjab  Health Foundation Act, 1992,  being a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecial law, having empowered (PHF) to grant loans. ◊ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n12.     Although I  could not  find any case law in this particular situation but inference could be drawn on the basis of judgments  of the superior courts having dealt with such like matters. Reliance is placed on the judgment passed in case reported as "Khalid  Javed Vs. State etc"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.?

Reliance  is placed  on a case reported  as Tariq Mehmood V. Askari Leasing Ltd  IPL D 2009 (Lahore) 629].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n13.     In the  instant  case  the  loan  issued  by respondent No.2  in favour  of petitioner  has  been  secured  through  a mortgage  deed No.  398 dated 24.03.2007 registered  with Sub-Registrar, Pattoki  District Kasur. In case of default, a mode   has   been   provided  under   clause   (12)   of  the agreement   whereby,   respondent No.2   may  issue  show cause notice to the borrower  to pay the loan immediately alongwith  penalty  which  may  be in the  shape  of sale of mortgaged   property  and   recovery    of arrears   of  land revenue under Revenue Recovery,  Act, 1890.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n14.      In presence of these  clauses in the agreement,  I am of  the   considered    view   that   respondent  No.2   is  not competent to resort  to the provision  of Section  489-F  of the Pakistan  Penal Code,  1860 and any such action will be nullity  in the eyes of law as held in the renowned pronouncements made by the superior Courts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n15.      For  what  has  been  discussed   above,  I  allow  the instant   writ  petition   and  set-aside   the  impugned   letter dated  10.07 .2012  which has recommended registration of an FIR  against  the petitioner  under  Section  489-F  of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPakistan  Penal Code,  1860 .\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n. ?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n( SHAH  KHAWAR)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nAPPROVED FOR REPORTING\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n               \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2002 YLR 2444, PLD 2005 SC 686, 1993 SCMR 1853, PLD 1981 SC 352, 1992 SCMR 2192'),

MUHAMMD MASOOD JAHANGIR, J.- This\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\njudgment will decide C.R.No.2147 of 2004 and C.R.No.1369 of\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n2004, which involve common questions of law and facts and are between the same parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.                 The facts germane for the disposal of the instant civil revisions are that Muhammad Yasin petitioner (hereinafter will be referred as plaintiff) filed a suit for declaration against Muhammad Jamil and Saidan Bibi respondents (hereinafter will be referred as defendants) with the assertion that the disputed property was owned by Majeed s/o Karman (the description of the property is fully mentioned in para-1 of the plaint), who was an old age person and also due to  brain paralysis in the beginning of March 1993  he became  incapable  of  speaking,  moving  and  thinking.  He  also became unconscious in the last twenty five days of his life and ultimately he died on 05.4.1993, that defendant No.1 Muhammad Jamil was the nephew of the deceased whereas defendant No.2\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSaidan Bibi was his widow, that defendant No.1 got entered Rapt Roznamcha dated 22.3.1993 and thereafter mutation of oral gift No.519 dated 27.3.1993 in his favour in connivance with Revenue officials and the said Rapt as well as the disputed mutation were product of fraud as at that time the alleged donor Majeed was not capable of making offer of gift and the said deceased did not get entered the said rapt or got attested the disputed mutation as he was suffering from Marz-al-Maut. The said suit was resisted by the defendant Muhammad Jamil by filing his written statement. No doubt the said written statement also bears the name of Saidan Bibi the other defendant but it transpired from the record that latter on defendant No.2 denied the filing of the said written statement alongwith Muhammad Jamil defendant No.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.                 The learned trial court captured the disputed area of facts by striking following issues:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Whether  the  mutation  No.519  dated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27.3.1993 was got sanctioned by the deceased Majeed during Marzul Maut?OPP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  If issue No.1 is proved in affirmative, so, its effect?OPP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the decree of declaration and possession\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas well as permanent injunction as prayed for?OPP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Whether the plaintiff has got no cause of action?OPD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  Whether this suit is improperly valued for the purposes of court fee and jurisdiction, if so, what is real valuation of this suit?OPD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.  Whether   this   suit   is   hit   by   the provisions of Section 172 of the land Revenue Act?OPD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Whether  this  suit  is  false  and frivolous,     if     so,     whether     the\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\ndefendants are entitled to recover the special costs u/s m35-A of CPC?OPD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.  Relief.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n4.                 Both the parties produced their evidence before the learned trial court in pros and cons and ultimately the suit was dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 16.3.2001. Being aggrieved  the plaintiff filed  an  appeal before the learned  lower appellate court and the learned lower appellate court vide judgment and decree dated 6.5.2004 declared the gift as a valid transaction only to the extent of 1/3 share of the disputed property whereas the rest of the disputed property was declared the legacy of deceased and was to be inherited by legal heirs according to Islamic shares. The plaintiff filed Civil Revision No.2147 of 2004 and defendant No.1 filed Civil Revision No.1369 of 2004 against the said judgments and decrees passed by both the courts below, which are being disposed of jointly this single judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.                 The learned counsel for the plaintiff has argued that both the courts below while passing the impugned judgments and decrees did not consider that onus of issues No.1 & 2 was on the parties and the plaintiff produced best available evidence to discharge his part of onus, but in its rebuttal the defendant No.1 failed to discharge his onus, therefore, the impugned judgments and decrees passed by both the courts below are not sustainable, that deceased was an ailing person having 70/72 years age who died just after 8/9 days of the so called execution of oral gift and these facts coupled with the late/ailing age of the deceased itself would show that the deceased was suffering from a disease which could be fatal,\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nas such proceedings, of oral gift were made in a hasty manner which casted shadow of doubt on the conduct of defendant No.1, that both the courts below while passing the impugned judgments also   overlooked   the   statement   of   DW7   (Muhammad   Jamil defendant No.1) that deceased was suffering from brain paralysis, that once it was admitted by defendant No.1 being DW7 that deceased did suffer from brain paralysis thus onus heavily shifted on him to prove that he was capable of making valid gift by the production of medical evidence regarding his treatment. He lastly prayed that the impugned judgments and decrees passed by both the courts below being result of misreading and non-reading are liable to be set aside by declaring the same illegal, unlawful and without jurisdiction. The learned counsel for the plaintiff has relied upon the judgments reported as KHAN MUHAMMAD VS. MUHAMMAD DIN THROUGH LRS (2010 SCMR 1351), MUHAMMAD AKRAM AND ANOTHER VS. ALTAF AHMAD (PLD 2003 SC 688), HAJI ILAHI BAKHSH VS. NOOR MUHAMMAD AND OTHERS (PLD 1985 SC 41), ZULFIQAR AND OTHERS VS. SHAHDAT KHAN (PLD 2007 SC 582), ALLAH WASAYA AND ANOTHER VS. FALAK SHER AND ANOTHER (2001 CLC 280), MUHAMMAD MAQBOOL VS. MUHAMMAD AKBAR AND OTHERS (1999 MLD 2536), WAQQAR  AMBALVI  VS.  FAQIR  ALI  AND  OTHERS  (1969\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCMR 189), CHIEF ENGINEER, IRRIGATION DEPARTMENT, N.W.F.P. PESHAWAR AND 2 OTHERS VS. MAZHAR  HUSSAIN  AND  2  OTHERS  (PLD  2004  SC  682),\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHAFIZ TASSADUQ HUSSAIN VS. LAL KHATOON AND OTHERS (PLD 2011 SC 296), MST. CHANAN BIBI AND 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHERS  VS.  MUHAMMAD  SHAFI  AND  3  OTHERS  (PLD\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n1977 SC 28), NOOR MUHAMMAD KHAN AND 3 OTHERS VS. HABIBULLAH KHAN AND 27 OTHERS (PLD 1994 SC 650), KARAM BEGUM AND 3 OTHERS VS. ALLAH DITTA AND 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHERS (PLD 1986 SC (AJ & K) 27), MUHAMMAD BAKHSH VS. ELLAHI BUKHSH AND OTHERS (2003 SCMR 286), BARKAT ALI THROUGH LEGAL HEIRS AND OTHERS (2002\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCMR 1938) and MUKHTAR AHMAD VS. MST. RASHEEDA BIBI AND ANOTHER (2003 SCMR 1664) to contend that the suit was liable to be decreed as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.                 Conversely the learned counsel for the defendant has argued that heavy onus was laid upon the plaintiff to prove that deceased having been affected with mental incapacity and physical infirmity could not constitute a valid gift as an independent person, but he neither produced any medical certificate nor the physician to discharge  the  onus  of  issue  No.1,  that  the  learned  Additional District Judge after holding that mutation was properly sanctioned could not held that the gift had been made by the deceased during Marzul Maut, that the learned lower appellate court has failed to consider that when the parties adduced their evidence and onus of issue No.1 was on the parties, which loses its significance, that the learned  lower  appellate  court  without  assessing  the  material available on file has passed the impugned judgment and decree on erroneous premises of law. The learned counsel for the defendant\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nrelied upon the judgments reported as JEWAN KHAN AND OTHERS VS. FEROZE (PLD 1951 LAHORE 433), MST. JIVANEE  VS.  FEROZE  DIN  AND  ANOTHER  (PLD  1962\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW.P.(REV.54), MST. CHANAN BIBI AND 4 OTHERS VS. MUHAMMAD SHAFI AND 3 OTHERS (PLD 1977 SC 28). He lastly prayed for setting aside of the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned lower appellate court and prayed for restoration of the judgment and decree passed by the learned trial court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.                 Arguments heard and record perused.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n8.                 It is an admitted fact that Majeed s/o Karman was the owner of the disputed property and he died on 5.4.1993 leaving behind his brother/plaintiff, widow Saidan Bibi defendant No.1 and his nephew Muhammad Jamil defendant No.1. His death was got entered   in   the   relevant   register   of   death   on   20.5.1993   by Muhammad Jamil defendant No.1. This document is available on file as Exh.D8 at page 64. The column No.8 is relevant, which assigned the reason of death as brain paralysis. It is significant that the said entry was got recorded by defendant No.1 himself and prior  to  the  death  of  deceased  Majeed  a  Rapt  in  Roznamcha Waqiati of the Patwari   Exh.D2 was alleged to be got entered on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22.3.1993 by the alleged donor Majeed deceased. It is also admitted by the counsel for the defendant No.1 that mutation of gift No.519\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExh.D1 was attested by the Revenue Officer on 27.3.1993 in the absence of alleged donor Majeed deceased on the strength of Rapt\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRoznamcha Exh.D2. These documents Exh.D1 & D2 are relevant for consideration by this Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.                 To  prove the fact that deceased  had been  suffering from   mental   incapacity/brian   paralysis,   the   plaintiff   himself appeared as PW1 and produced Muhammad Usman as PW2. Both the said PWs categorically deposed in their examination in chief that deceased had been affected with mental infirmity and also a man of old age. The said portion of their deposition has not been cross examined by defendant No.1. It is a settled principle of law that if a material fact has been deposed in the examination in chief, but is not questioned during the cross examination, the same shall be deemed to have been admitted in view of the dictum laid down by the superior Courts in  the judgments reported as  WAQQAR AMBALVI VS. FAQIR ALI AND OTHERS (1969 SCMR 189), CHIEF ENGINEER, IRRIGATION DEPARTMENT, N.W.F.P. PESHAWAR AND 2 OTHERS VS. MAZHAR HUSSAIN AND 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHERS (PLD 2004 SC 682), (2009 YLR 289), (2000 MLD 404), (PLD 1967 LAHORE 1138) and (PLD 2011 SC 296).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.               The deposition of PW1 & PW2 is further corroborated by Ali Jan PW3, who was Lumberdar of the village while stating that entry of death in register of death (Exh.D8) maintained by him was got entered by defendant No.1 himself after appearing before him. The said entry was thereafter incorporated in the register of death maintained by the Secretary Union Council. The perusal of basic  document  Exh.P3  &  P4  maintained  by  village  headman depicts that in column No.10 of the said register the duration of\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nailment of the deceased was shown to be 25 days whereas such duration was not shown in the copy of register of death Exh.D8, which was maintained by Union Council concerned. The bird”≥ eye view of the said death certificate (Exh.D8) depicts that column of duration of ailment was not visible and has been intentionally omitted to be photocopied as the other columns are shown in seriatim but the said column is missing. To prove the  cause of death, the plaintiff produced relevant Lumberdar Ali Jan as PW3 who corroborated the entry of Exh.P3 & P4. The said PW was cross examined by the counsel for the defendant No.1 but the veracity of his evidence could not be shaken\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11.               To rebut the evidence of said PW3, defendant No.1 produced Nasir Mehmood, Secretary Union, Council as DW8, who deposed that in his register column No.10 regarding the duration of ailment was left blank by the former Secretary, Union Council and only dash was marked in the said column. Nasir Mehmood DW8 was not a concerned person who had entered death entry of the deceased  Majeed  rather  during  the  cross-examination  it  was clarified that Abdul Karim Chaudhry, Secretary, Union Council had entered the said entry, but the said Secretary was not produced by defendant No.1 to prove the contents of Exh.D8. As a column of duration of ailment was provided in Exh.D8 and Exh.P3 and in the initial record maintained by Lumberdar the duration of ailment was mentioned, which has been proved by the said Lumberdar, the non- mentioning of duration of ailment in the register of death by Secretary,  Union  Council  which  has  also  not  been  proved  by\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nproducing the relevant Secretary, Union Council an inference can be drawn that prior entry made in the register of Lumberdar had a preference  over  the  entry  which  was  subsequently  made  by Secretary Union Council on the basis of the record maintained by the Lumberdar but omitted to copy the duration of ailment of the deceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.               The contention of learned counsel for defendant No.1 that plaintiff was under obligation to prove the fact that at the time of entry of Rapt Roznamcha and attestation of mutation regarding the gift of disputed property, the donor was suffering from death illness was on the plaintiff, but he failed to prove the said fact is misconceived. Marzul Maut means a disease aggravated that deceased person apprehended that death was more probable than a chance to live, it was only where a person had become so much aggravated that  he was  depending  to  apprehend  that  death  was more  probable  than  his  chance  to  live, then  the person  can  be considered to be suffering from Marzul Maut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.               The plaintiff proved the said fact by producing PW1 & P2, whose testimony to the extent that Majeed had been suffering from death illness has not been cross examined and deemed to be admitted by defendant No.1 as observed supra. The said oral evidence has also been supported by the  documentary evidence (Exh.P3 & P4) wherein duration of ailment of said deceased spread over twenty five days and the entry of Rapt Roznamcha Waqiati Exh.D2 and attestation of mutation Exh.D1 definitely fell in the said duration. The defendant No.1 in his written statement denied\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nthe old age of deceased Majeed at the time of his death, but same has also been affirmed by death entry as mentioned in Exh.P3 & P4 and exh.D8 that deceased was almost about 70 years of age at the time of his death. After reading entire evidence available on file it does not appeal to a prudent man that Majeed deceased at the age of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n70 years while confined to bed had the mental capacity to make an intelligent decision with regard to his landed property. Muhammad Jamil  defendant  No.1  had  a  motive  to  usurp  the  property  of deceased to deprive the other legal heirs of Majeed deceased, who at the relevant time was admittedly living with defendant Muhammad Jamil and totally dependent on him. The Rapt Roznamcha Waqiati Exh.D2 was got recorded on 22.3.1993 and the mutation was attested on 27.3.1993 whereas Majeed took his last breathe  on  5.4.1993  after  8/9  days  of  the  attestation  of  said mutation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.               In the above fact and circumstances of the case it is proved that on 22.3.1993 and 27.3.1993, at the time of entry of the Rapt Roznamcha Waqiati and attestation of mutation, Majeed deceased had been suffering from Marzul Maut, who was not a person  competent to  make an  intelligent decision, hence the so called transaction reflected in the Rapt Roznamcha Waqiati as well as in the mutation in my view was hit by the vice of mischief and has also could not be proved by defendant No.1 Muhammad Jamil. Reliance in this respect can be placed upon the judgments reported as (1999 SCMR 1049), (1992 SCMR 553) and MUHAMMAD SIDDIQUE AND 3 OTHERS VS. MUHAMMAD BOOTA AND\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOTHERS (2009 MLD 917). The case law cited by the learned counsel for the defendant No.1 is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the instant case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.               The plaintiff (PW1) stated on oath that disputed Rapt Roznamcha Waqiati as well as mutation (Exh.D2 & D3) were result of fraud and connivance, thus the onus was shifted upon defendant No.1 to prove the transaction of gift independently as well as the attestation of mutation and entry of Rapt in dispute. The defendant No.1 did not plead any of the three ingredients of gif in his written statement that when, where and in whose presence the oral transaction of gift was effected as he failed to give any date, time, venue and even the name of witnesses. Furthermore the defendant also failed to prove the transaction of gift through his evidence. There must be an offer on behalf of the donor regarding the gift of the disputed property to the donee and that offer must be accepted by the alleged donee and possession of the disputed property was also to be handed over by the donor to the donee, which should be followed by the subsequent event that the said transaction was reported to the patwari for the entry of the same in the register Roznamcha Waqiati and attestation of mutation. The beneficiary/defendant No.1 was bound to prove the alleged transaction of gift as well as the following events by producing reliable and cogent evidence and in the absence of such proof, the mutation of oral gift No.519 in favour of defendant No.1 is liable to be cancelled. Reliance in this respect is placed upon the judgments reported as (2010 SCMR 1351), (PLD 2003 SC 688), (PLD 1985\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSC 41) and (PLD 2007 SC 582). The findings rendered by the learned courts below on issues No.1 to 3 are erroneous and not supported by the evidence on the record as well as the law on the subject. Even the learned lower appellate court has passed the contradictory order as on the one hand it was observed that the transaction of gift was made by Abdul Majeed deceased during Marz-al-Maut, but surprisingly the disputed gift was upheld to the extent 1/3rd of the property whereas in such an eventuality the same was to be declared null and void as a whole because in view of the observation of this Court in the preceding paras, having been falling in the state of Marz-al-Maut due to paralysis of brain, was unable to make intelligent decision with regard to this landed property. As such the findings of the learned courts below on issues No.1 to 3, which are inter linked with each other, are reversed and the said issues are decided in favour of the petitioner/plaintiff. However,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremaining issues No.4 to 7 were already answered by the learned trial court against the defendant/respondent No.1 and the said findings were not challenged by filing any cross-objections, hence the said findings cannot be re-opened when the learned counsel for respondent No.1/defendant has also failed to contradict the said findings of the learned trial court from any evidence available on the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16.               Sequel of the above discussion is that the instant civil revision is allowed, the judgments and decrees passed by both the courts below are set aside and the suit filed by the plaintiff is decreed with costs throughout. The suit property will be devolved upon all the legal heirs of Abdul Majeed deceased according to\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\ntheir legal shares. The civil revision No.1369 of 2004 filed by the defendant is dismissed.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n(CH.

Concisely put, the fact, are that the petitioner purchased six properties in the year 2012 through six registered sale deeds, situated in Sahiwal. It is maintained by him in the writ petition that he paid the requisite stamp duty on all the sale deeds together with the registration fees prescribed therefor. However, on 31.1.2013, Sub-Registrar Sahiwal, respondent No.2 issued a notice to the petitioner to pay another amount of Rs.100,2000/- within three days, failing which he threatened to adopt coercive measures for the recovery of the aforesaid amount.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.       The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  argues  that  the impugned notice issued by respondent No.2 is illegal, without lawful authority and of no legal effect.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n4.       The learned Law Officer made a feeble attempt to defend the notice issued by the Sub-Registrar Sahiwal under the Stamp Act, 1899. On a Court query, the Sub-Registrar, Sahiwal present in the Court query, the Sub-Registrar, Sahiwal present in the Court replied that in point of fact he was asked to do so by the Collector, Sahiwal.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5.       Before  proceeding  further,  it  is  worthwhile  to  reproduce\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSection 31 of the Stamp Act, 1899:-\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n‘Ådjudication as to proper stamp.- (1)   When any instrument, whether executed or not and whether previously stamped or not, is brought to the Collector, and the person bringing it applies to have the opinion of that officer as to the duty (if any) with which it is chargeable, and pays a fee of such amount (not exceeding five rupees) and not less than (fifty paisa) as the Collector may in each case direct, the Collector shall determine the duty (if any) with which, in his judgment, the instrument is chargeable.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(2)     For this purpose the Collector may require to be furnished with an abstract of the instrument, and also with such affidavit or other evidence as he may deem necessary to prove that all the facts and circumstances affecting the chargeability of the instrument with duty, or the amount of the duty with which it is chargeable, are fully and truly set forth therein, and may refuse to proceed upon any such application until such abstract and evidence have been furnished accordingly:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProvided that-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(a)     no  evidence  furnished  in  pursuance  of  this  section shall be used against any person in any civil proceeding, except  in  an  enquiry  as  to  the  duty  with  which  the instrument to which it relates is chargeable; and\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(b)     every person by whom any such evidence is furnished shall, on payment of the full duty with which the instrument to  which  it  relates  is  chargeable,  be  relieved  from  any penalty  which  he  may  have  incurred  under  this  Act  by reason of the omission to state truly in such instrument any of the facts or circumstances aforesaid.‘å\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n6.       A bare perusal of the afore-quoted provision of law shows that it is the Collector of a District alone who is empowered to issue a notice calling upon the delinquent to make up for the stamp duty. Furthermore, he would first determine the shortfall in stamp duty. No doubt, in order to determine the exact stamp duty payable on an instrument, he may require any person to furnish information either by affidavits or otherwise. He may also hold an inquiry and record the evidence to arrive at the correct conclusion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n8.     It can hardly be overemphasized that the Sub-Registrar appointed under section 6 of the Registration Act, 1908 figures nowhere in the scheme of things. He is not authorized to issue any notice under the Stamp Act, 1899 regarding a shortfall in stamp duty on an instrument. He stands precluded from doing so even if it comes to his knowledge that the instrument registered by him required the payment of additional stamp duty. At best, he may lay this information before the Collector. Thereafter, he would have to wait for the decision of the Collector. Again, the Collector cannot delegate his authority to the Sub-Registrar. It is well-established law that when law specifies a thing to be done in a particular manner, it must be done in that manner or not at all.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n9.       Looking at the impugned notice issued by the Sub-Registrar Sahiwal, respondent No.2 in the light of the law laid down by the legislature in Section 31 of the Stamp Act, 1899, the same is a nullity and liable to be struck down. Consequently, the impugned notice dated 31.1.2013 issued by respondent No.2 is declared to\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nhave  been  passed  without  lawful  authority.  The  same  being without jurisdiction is hereby set aside. As a result, this petition is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n(MAHMOOD AHMAD BHATTI) JUDGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApproved for reporting\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nJUDGE\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRana Zahid Bashir*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '');

Anwar-ul-Haq, Advocate for the respondent.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe appellants by way of present appeal preferred under section 12 of Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance, IV of 1979 have called in question the legality of order dated 01.03.2011, whereby the learned ADJ, Jhang dismissed application of the appellants. Since the appeal is barred by time, therefore, the appellants have filed application under section 5 of the Limitation Act,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1908 (C.M No.02-C of 2011) seeking condonation of delay in preferring FAO No.375 of 2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.      Feeling    aggrieved    of    notification    dated\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n14.07.1970  issued  by  Auqaf Department/respondent, the appellants/applicants filed an application under section 11 of the Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance, IV of 1979, seeking a declaration that land measuring 151 kanals 18- marlas along with residential houses/superstructure built therein, located in Mouza Bhangoo, Tehsil Shorkot, District Jhang is not a Waqf Property and could not have been taken over by the respondent/Waqf  Department.  In  the  said application, it was stated that the land is owned and possessed by the family of the appellants/applicants and it has never been dedicated as Waqf within the\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nmeaning of said Ordinance. It was stated that in the ‘äamabandi‘†pertaining to the year 1924 in the column of ownership, Khanqah Hamid Shah was recorded, which was contrary to the previous entries and name of owner was dropped and according to the appellants/applicants this change of entry in the ‘äamanbandi‘† was  brought  in,  without  any attestation of mutation and in column of possession names of Noor Hassan, Allah Ditta sons of Ameer Bakhsh and Muhammad Bakhsh son of Cheragh Shah were recorded and the same entry was recorded in the record prepared thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.      The petition was contested by the respondent by filing written reply. It was stated that notification was issued on 14.07.1970 and as such the application was barred by time. On merits, it was stated that status of the appellants/applicants was not more than of a ‘Üaqir‘†or ‘çujawar‘†of the ‘ãhanqah‘Øshrine situated therein and mere possession in such capacity did not give any right or title of ownership to them or a cause of action to challenge  the  impugned  notification.  The  learned trial court in view of the divergent pleading of the parties framed the following issues:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Whether the application under section 11 of the Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance IV of 1979 is time barred, hence, is liable to be dismissed?OPR\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n2. Whether  the  present  petition  is  hit  by principle of res judiciata and not maintainable?OPR\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n3. Whether the petitioner has no locus standi to    challenge    the    Notification    dated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.07.1970 and does not have any cause of action to file this application?OPR\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n4. Whether the applicant is estopped through his words and conduct to file the instant application?OPR\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n5. Whether  the  petition  has  been  filed  with malafide  to  harass  the  respondent  and thus, the respondent is entitled to special costs under section 35-A CPC?OPR\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n6. Whether  no  entery  in  the  ≈äAMABANDI? could be made without attestation of mutation and entry in the last settlement of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1924-25    resulting   in   the   change    of ownership of predecessor of the petitioner,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas   without   lawful   authority  and   of   no consequence?OPA\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n7. Relief.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n4.      The learned counsel for the applicants/appellants has contended that the findings rendered by the trial court on the issue No.2 are not based on the evidence of the appellants. The learned counsel for the applicants/appellants in support of his application moved under section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1908 states that counsel   for   applicants/appellants   told   them   that   on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.07.2011, the High Court would close for summer vacations and appeal could be filed  on the 1st   day of September, 2011 on opening of the courts; that the wrong advice by the counsel is a sufficient ground for condonation of delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.      Learned  counsel  for  respondent  has  pointed  out that there is no affidavit sworn by the counsel, who had given alleged wrong advice to the applicants/appellants. It was further contended that appeal filed before this Court is hopelessly time barred.     Also states that applicants/appellants have no locus standi to challenge the  notification  dated  14.07.1970  as  revenue  record shows that they were not owners of land nor they challenged the entries of revenue record from 1852 to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1970 at any forum.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n6.      As the appeal is time barred by sixty two days, it is not necessary to go into merits of the case.   The applicants/appellants have filed an application for the condonation of delay under section 5 of Limitation Act,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1908 on the following grounds:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.      ‘îhat counsel for petitioners also told that on\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n12.07.2011 the High Court will close for summer  vacations,  so  the  appeal  could  be filed in September, 2011 on the 1st day of opening the Court‘ç\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.      From the contents of Para No.3 of application for condonation of delay, it appears that it is highly vague. Neither the name of the learned counsel, who advised them as mentioned in the application nor the date when said advice was tendered has been stated in the application. It may be stated that there is no affidavit on behalf of the counsel for the applicants/appellants that he had given alleged advice to them/applicants. However, even if it is assumed that any such wrong advice was given that is not sufficient cause to condoning the delay as same is given due to counsel?s negligence.  It is held in the  case  of   Mst.  Mahmood  Begum  v.  Major  Malik Muhammad Ishaq (1985 SCMR 890) that ignorance of law on the part of a counsel cannot be condoned and the party concerned may seek redressal of his grievance against the counsel.  It is held in the case of (Muhammad Manzoor v. Ghulam Murtaza (1994 SCMR 987) that no supporting  affidavit  of  the  Advocate  has  been  filed. Without it condonation is not possible.   It is also held in the case of  Abdul Ghani v. Ghulam Sarwar (PLD 1977\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSC 102) that mistaken advice by the counsel by itself is not  a  sufficient  ground  for condonation  of  delay in  all circumstances unless it is shown that the advice rendered with due care and attention.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n8.  Another aspect of the case is that the applicants/appellants filed an application under section 11 of the Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance, IV of 1979. After recording evidence of the parties learned trial court dismissed  the  application  of  applicants/appellants  on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n01.03.2011.  The  applicants/appellants  applied  for obtaining the certified copies of the judgment and decree dated 01.03.2011 on 18.03.2011 by lapse of 14 days. The   certified   copy   was   prepared   and   received   on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27.04.2011 and having only 46 days period to institute appeal in terms of section 12 of the Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance, IV of 1979.   The appeal is filed before this Court on 13.08.2011 and the same is admittedly barred by 62 days.  Whereas for condonation of delay an application under section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1908 has been preferred through  C.M No.02-C of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2011.   Admittedly, the provisions of section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1908 have been excluded from the application to the cases covered by Special Law and the cases under the Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance, IV of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1979 being a special law cannot be governed the proceedings or the limitation period by section 5 of the Limitation  Act,  1908.    Period  of  limitation  for  filing  of appeal has been prescribed in section 12 of the Punjab Waqf Properties Ordinance, IV of 1979, which is within sixty days of the order, which is reproduced as under:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.    Appeal   against  the  decision  of  District\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCourt:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n‘Åny person aggrieved by a decision of the\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDistrict Court under sub-section (1) of Section\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n11 may, within sixty days of the order, appeal\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nto the High Court‘ç\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n9.      I am of the considered view that when Limitation is provided by any special enactment, other than the Limitation Act, section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1908 is not\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\napplicable   for   condonation   of   delay.       Thus   the submissions made by the learned counsel for the applicants/appellants for condonation of delay have no force.   In this   view  of   the  matter, no sufficient cause for condonation of delay is made out with the result that C.M No.2-C of 2011 is rejected. The appeal preferred by the appellant is held to be barred by time and same is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso dismissed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n*Tariq\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nApproved for reporting.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nJudge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Aalia Neelum) Judge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '(1992) 66 Tax 246 SC Pak, AIR 1941 Lahore 195, AIR 1927 PC 102, AIR 1953 SC 153, AIR 1960 Patna 344, PLD 1967 Dacca 145, 1994 MLD 2329'),

The respondent/defendant No.1 contested the suit by filing the written statements through Mian Muhammad Afzal, aAdvocate, but afterwards the alleged compromise was recorded on 07.4.2010 between the petitioner/plaintiff and the alleged appointed counsel of the respondent/defendant  No.1.  On  the  basis  of  said  compromise,  the learned trial court disposed of the suit vide order dated 09.4.2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.            The respondent/defendant No.1 assailed the aforesaid order dated 09.4.2010 by filing an application under section 12(2) of CPC. The petitioner/plaintiff contested the said application and the learned trial court after analyzing the divergent pleadings of the parties, framed the following issues:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na.	Whether in the  light  of  averment  of  written statement i.e. blanket refusal of agreement to sell counsel for the petitioner company   Mian   Muhammad   Afzal   Advocate   was   not authorized  to  make  consenting  written  statement  and  to receive any amount of consideration? OP Parties.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nb.	whether   the   concessional   statement   dated   7.4.2010   by submitting a new agreement Mark-A was not permitted as per Wakalat Nama of the company issued in the name of Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate? OP. Parties.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nc.       Relief.\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\n3.            After recording evidence of the parties, the learned trial court accepted the application filed by respondent/defendant No.1 vide order dated 09.12.2011, hence the instant Civil Revision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.            The learned counsel for the petitioner/plaintiff has argued that the impugned order passed by the learned trial court is against facts and circumstances of the case; that the learned trial court has committed illegality and material irregularity while passing the impugned order; that the counsel for respondent/defendant No.1 being the attorney was fully authorized to enter into com0promise on the basis of power of attorney, who had rightly entered into comp0romsie with the petitioner/plaintiff after receiving the amount on behalf of respondent/defendant No.1; that the learned trial court has failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested to it in a proper manner through the impugned order, which is liable to be set aside by allowing the instant revision petition.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5.            On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent/defendant No.1 has refuted the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner/plaintiff  and  submitted  that  the  alleged  agreement  to  sell dated 29.12.2003, the bone of contention of the suit for specific performance filed by the petitioner-plaintiff, was a forged document having been prepared without the knowledge and consent of the respondent/defendant No.1; that Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate had been appointed as a counsel for appearance in the court to contest the suit, who was not especially authorized by respondent/defendant No.1 to settle the dispute while effecting compromise with the petitioner- plainiff or to make anyIqrarnama and the act of the said counsel was apparently based on fraudulent and without authorization, therefore, the learned trial court has  rightly exercised the jurisdiction vested in it\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\nwhile   invoking the provision  under   section  12  (2) CPC  on  valid reasons through the impugned order, which is liable to be maintained while dismissal of the titled revision petition having no merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.          Arguments heard and record perused.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n7.         The petitioner/plaintiff had filed a suit for specific performance on the basis of alleged agreement to sell dated 29.12.2003 against the respondent/defendant No.1. The said suit was contested by respondent/defendant No.1 as well as respondents No.3 to 14 by filing independent written statements. It is pertinent to note that in para 3 of the preliminary objections, respondent/defendant No.1 categorically asserted   that   the   impugned   agreement   dated   29.12.2003   was   a fraudulent document having been forged and maneuvered by the petitioner-plaintiff as M. H. Shah, the alleged executants/signatory thereof had been retired from their company on 16.12.1996 and thereafter he died on 14.9.2002. Respondents No.3  to 14 also denied the existence of the disputed agreement on the objection as narrated above  as  well  as  other  factual  aspects.  Thereafter,  the     counsel appointed by respondent No.1 made a statement on 07.4.2010 and furnished a compromise deed Exh-R-2 before the learned trial court on the basis whereof the suit was disposed of vide order dated 09.4.2010 in the following manner:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n”™**Hence, suit is disposed of in the light of statements of parties dated 7.4.2010 but for the purpose of registration of suit property in the name of plaintiff parties are directed to approach the concerned registering   authority   who   after   verifying   the   title   documents   of defendants No.1 qua suit property and after taking the requisite stamp duty/transfer fee etc. will do the needful to transfer the suit property in the name of plaintiff. It is also mentioned here that the plaintiff and defendants No.3 to 14 are claiming themselves to be occupants of the suit property, therefore, both these parties are directed to avail alternate remedy in this regard. No order regarding determination of possession of these parties is made here‘Æ\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA perusal of the said order reveals that the learned trial court did not decree the suit rather directed the parties to appear before the Sub-\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\nRegistrar for registration of the deed regarding the suit property. The said order dated 9.4.2010 passed by the learned trial court was in no way helpful to the petitioner/plaintiff as to may view it is not executable in the eye of law.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n8.       The respondent/defendant No.1 came forward by filing an application under section 12(2) CPC on the ground that the aforesaid order  having been based on fraud and misrepresentation was liable to be set aside and the counsel for the respondent-defendant No.1 had acted beyond the authority conferred upon him. In support thereof, the respondent-defendant No.1 produced its authorized agent Iftikhar Ahmad, as AW-1, who stated that although Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate had been appointed as a counsel, but he was not authorized to enter into compromise with the petitioner/plaintiff while delegating any specific authority to him in this respect and he was also not authorized to receive the amount from the petitioner/plaintiff on behalf of respondent/defendant No.1 and he has done all this without the permission and at the back of respondent-defendant No.1. Conversely, the petitioner-plaintiff himself appeared as RW-1 and produced Muhammad Ijaz (RW2) and Intikhab Alam (RW3). The stance of the said RWs that compromise deed (Ex:R2) had been executed in their presence and it was signed by Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate on behalf of the respondent-defendant No.1 is not helpful to the petitioner- plaintiff as their testimony is silent on the issue that the said attorney had  specifically been  authorized  to  effect  compromise on  behalf  of respondent-defendant No.1 and he had acted in letter and spirit of the authority conferred upon him through the power of attorney (Ex:R1). Een otherwise the petitioner-plaintiff also failed to produce Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate to prove the contents of power of attorney\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\n(Ex:R1). On the other hand a careful study of the said Vakalatnama- power of attorney (Ex:R1) reveals that the executent/respondent- defendant No.1 had authorized the said Advocate only to receive on his behalf the sums and amounts deposited in his account. So, said clause of the power of attorney appears to have not been strictly construed and it can be safely inferred that Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate had never been authorized to receive amounts from the petitioner/plaintiff unless it was deposited in the account of respondent/defendant No.1. A further perusal of the said power of attorney (Ex:R1) also reveals that no specific authority had been conferred on the counsel/attorney for formation of compromise deed (Ex:R2) and production thereof before the court to settle the dispute in the shape of compromise.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n9.      It is settled principle of law that power of attorney should always be construed strictly and the power/authority having not been specifically given to any attorney or omitted to flow from the contents of document should not be deemed to have been conferred on the attorney concerned. General terms occurring in such document for the purpose of appointing the attorney should be interpreted with reference to the object for which such power of attorney was executed. So intention and object for which such power of attorney was construed is an important factor. It has been held in PLD 1987 Lahore 392 that under Order XXX rule 2 CPC specific powers to be given to the recognized agent otherwise acts should not be binding. A safe reliance can also be placed on 1987 CLC 813. Moreover, on the authority of the case law declared in PLD 1969 Karachi 123 and 1995 CLC 1572 it is observed that power of attorney confers only those powers, which are specified therein and the agent may neither go beyond nor deviate from the terms of this instrument. The august Supreme Court in the case\r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\nreported as 1992 SCMR 1488 has held that in case of conflict and ambiguity it should be construed for benefit of the executant whereas in PLD 1985 SC 341 the law was laid down that the courts should be vigilant particularly when allegation by the Principal is of fraud. Moreover, as held in 1991 CLC Notes 67, the duty of the counsel is very sacred and he represents parties in adjudication of their rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.    For the foregoing discussion,  this court  is left  with  no option except to observe that Mian Muhammad Afzal, Advocate having not been authorized specifically by respondent/defendant No.1 to settle the dispute in the suit through compromise, the statement made by him before the court and the compromise deed (Exh.R2)  were nothing, but a deviation from the authority actually conferred by respondent/defendant No.1 upon him to contest the suit while executing power  of  attorney  in  his  favour  and  the  order  dated    09.4.2010 impugned  by filing  application  under  section  12(2)  CPC  cannot  be sustained in the eye of law as the act of the attorney amounted to play fraud with the court as well as the client to defeat his rights. As such the said order has rightly been struck off by the learned trial court while exercising powers conferred under section 12(2) CPC through the impugned order, which cannot be interfered with by this court in the revisional jurisdiction as the same is not found to be illegal or tainted with  misreading  or  non-reading  of  the  evidence  on  the  part  of  the learned trial court. Resultantly, this Civil Revision having no force is dismissed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(Ch.

Brief facts of the case are that Mst. Asiya Bibi Plaintiff/respondent No.3 filed a suit for recovery of maintenance allowance, recovery of dower and recovery of dowry articles against the petitioner/defendant which was contested by the petitioner/defendant  through  filing  of  contesting  written statement.  On  the basis  of divergent  pleadings  of the  parties following issues were framed:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1)	Whether  the  plaintiff  is  entitled  to  decree  for maintenance allowance from the defendant? If so, at what rate and for what period? OPP\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2)	Whether plaintiff is entitled to recover dower from the defendant as prayed for, if so on what grounds? OPP\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3)	Whether  the  plaintiff  No.1  is  entitled  to  recover dowry articles as per list annexed with the plait? OPP\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4)	Whether the suit of the plaintiff is false, frivolous, and concocted, the same is liable to be dismissed? OPP\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n5)	Whether the plaintiff has  not  come in  the court with clean hands and estopped by her words and conduct, if so, on what grounds? OPD\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6)	Whether the plaintiff has filed the instant suit just to blackmail and harass the defendant, the suit is false, frivolous and concocted and same is liable to be dismissed, if so, on what grounds? OPD\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n7)      Relief.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.       After  adducing  the  evidence  from  both  sides,  learned Judge Family Court decreed the suit @ Rs:2,000/- per month as future maintenance allowance; decreed the suit to the extent of Rs:100,000/- for recovery of dowry articles and also decreed the suit to the extent of 5 Marla plot along with four walls and ›†Tola Gold Ornaments for recovery of dower.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.       The   petitioner/defendant   being   aggrieved   from   the judgment and decree passed by learned trial court, preferred an appeal which was partially allowed by the learned Additional District Judge, Jalalpur Pirwala vide judgment and decree dated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27.06.2014 by setting aside the decree to the extent of future maintenance allowance, however, to  the extent  of remaining reliefs upheld the judgment and decree of learned trial court. Hence, this writ petition.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5.       The learned counsel for the petitioner/defendant argued that the impugned judgments and decrees passed by both the courts below are unwarranted by law and have been passed in a summary manner. He further argued that the judgments  and decrees passed by both the courts below to the extent of dower and dowry articles are not sustainable in the eyes of law. The learned counsel for the petitioner/defendant further argued that although the learned appellate court upheld the decision of trial court but the same is a result of misreading and non-reading of documentary and  oral  evidence.  The  learned  counsel  further referred  to  columns  No.14  and  15  of  “éikah  Nama“† where\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nagainst these columns, it is written that one house plot 5 Marla complete four walls Haq-ul-Mehar Ghair Mu”°jjal and argued that this dower could only be claimed by respondent No.3/plaintiff in case of divorce or death of the petitioner/defendant.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6.       I have considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner/defendant and perused the record carefully.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n7.       As far as the decree to the extent of Rs.1,00,000/- in lieu of  dowry  articles  upon  the  solitary  statement  of  respondent No.3; it is a settled principle of law that purpose of enacting the special law regarding the family disputes is to advance justice and  to  avoid  technicalities  which  are hindrance in  providing ultimate justice to the parties. It is pertinent to mention here that West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 was promulgated for the expeditious settlement and disposal of disputes relating to marriages and other family affairs and special procedure was provided to achieve this object and therefore, the legislature, in its  wisdom,  excluded  the  application  of  Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSection 17  of  the  Family  Courts  Act,  1964  is  reproduced below:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n”±7.  Provisions of Evidence Act and Code of Civil  Procedure  not  to  apply.  (1) Save  as otherwise expressly provided by or  under this Act,  the  provisions  of  the  [Qanun-e-Shahdat,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1984  (P.O.  No.10 of  1984)] and  the  Code of Civil   Procedure,   1908   [except   sections   10 and 11] shall not apply to proceedings before\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany  Family  Court,  [in  respect  of  part I  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSchedule]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(2) Sections 8 to 11 of the Oaths Act, 1873, shall apply to all proceedings before the Family Courts.‘å\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n8.       The purpose of enacting Family Courts Act, 1964 is to frustrate the technicalities for the purpose of justice between the parties in the shortest possible manner. All that the Family Courts Act, 1964 has done is that it has changed the forum, altered the method of trial and empowered the Court to grant better reliefs. The provisions of Civil Procedure Code, 1908 as well as Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 are not applicable in stricto senso to proceedings before the Family Court by virtue of Section 17 of the Act, 1964. Family Court has to regulate its own proceedings in accordance with the provisions of the Act,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1964; and in doing so it has to proceed on the premises that every procedure is  permissible unless  a clear prohibition  is found  in  law.  Therefore,  a  mere  fact  that  a  party  did  not formally prove a document is of no legal consequence.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt  is  observed  that  the  evidence  adduced  before  the Family Court cannot be evaluated and appraised in a manner as it is appreciated in the cases presented under Civil Procedure Code.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n9.       It has been held in  Mst. Shakeela Bibi Vs. Mohammad Israr and others (2012 MLD 756) that the solitary statement of wife is sufficient to prove the claim of dowry articles. It was further held that this notion is misconceived that the wife while making the claim for dowry articles was required to prove the case    in    terms    of    requirements    of    Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.  West  Pakistan  Family  Courts  Act, 1964  is  a special law and provisions of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 have been excluded through section 17 of the Act, 1964.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.     Since  both  the  courts  below  have  given  concurrent findings of fact against the petitioner/defendant, therefore, this Court, in its constitutional jurisdiction, cannot interfere with the findings of fact recorded by both the Courts below.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n11.     It is worth mentioning that in preliminary objection No.8 of the written statement, petitioner/defendant himself admitted that petitioner/defendant has paid the settled Haq-ul-Mehar worth Rs:1,000/- and no other Haq-ul-Mehar was settled at the time of Nikah and the remaining Haq-ul-Mehar mentioned in the Nikah Nama is a result of forgery and fabrication.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n12.     The perusal of written statement makes  it abundantly clear that the petitioner/defendant has not taken the plea of Ghair Mu”°jjal Haq-ul-Mehar in written statement; rather he denied the contents of the Nikah Nama. Moreover, when the plaintiff/respondent No.3 successfully proved the Nikah Nama by way of adducing her evidence, then petitioner/defendant took a diametrically opposite stance in the present writ petition. The plea raised in this writ petition was also not raised in the memo of appeal.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n13.     I have given my anxious considerations to the contents of Nikah Nama where the column No.14 which relates to the payment  of  the  dower  amount  in  Mu”°jjal  and  Mowajjal (prompt and deferred) was left blank while against the column No.15 which relates to the condition as to whether how much of the dower amount was paid at the time of Marriage; it is specifically mentioned that one house plot measuring 5 Marla which leads to the fact that all of the dower mentioned in the Nikah Nama was fixed and payable at the time of Marriage ceremony.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n14.     I am afraid that the defendant /petitioner cannot raise this plea for the first time before this Court in its extra ordinary constitutional jurisdiction. The family court is a court of ultimate jurisdiction which has power to record the evidence and to decide the factual controversies.  Both the courts below\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nhave concurrently found the plaintiff/respondent No.3 entitled for the grant of dower in terms of Nikah Nama (Ex-P/1).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n15.    In general terms, dower is defined as ‘çuajjal‘†and ‘çuwajjal‘†which is called prompt and deferred respectively. The prompt dower is payable immediately on demand whereas deferred dower is payable at a specified time and on consummation of marriage, the dower is right of the wife, whether  prompt  or  deferred  and  there  is  no  difference  of opinion between Islamic jurists regarding payment of prompt dower at the time of marriage or when it is demanded by the wife. However, various schools of thoughts have divergent opinion about the payment of deferred dower. According to ‘àanfi Fiqah‘†to which the most of the society belong in our Country, if the deferment or postponement is not specified and is   generally   described   as   deferred,   this   dower   will   be considered prompt and shall be payable accordingly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n16.     This Court would refer to Kitab-al-Fiq Ala-Madhahib- Al-Arbaha by Abdul Rehman Al-Jazairi, Volume 4, Page 153, Chapter  of  Nikah,  Published  at  Darul  Fiq,  and  Bidaie-As- Sanaie Fi Tarteeb Ash-Sharai by Allama Abu Bakar Alla-ud- Din Al-Qasmi Al-Hanfi, Volume 2, Page 288, to hold that the view that deferred dower is not payable unless the marriage is dissolved is not supported by any recognized principle based on some authority whereas   on the other hand, the deferred dower shall always be treated as prompt if no specified period for the payment of dower is fixed. This view is in conformity to the command of Holy Quran, therefore, in terms of Section\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6(5)(a) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 the immediate payment of entire amount of dower, whether prompt or deferred is obligatory in such cases.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n17.     The  only  difference  of  Mu”∑ajjal  and  Mu”°jjal  i.e. prompt and deferred is that deferred dower is not payable till the  arrival  of  stipulated  period  whereas  prompt  dower  is payable immediately on  demand  and  if for the payment  of deferred dower no stipulated time is fixed, it would be treated as prompt i.e. payable on demand. This leads this Court to the conclusion that deferred dower without specification of period or stipulation, shall be payable at any time upon demand.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n18.     Under the Islamic principle, the payment of dower is an essential obligation of the husband and his failure to pay the dower tantamounts to injustice and inequity. According to the Dictionary  of  Islam  by  Hughes,  ‘Ñower‘† is  considered  by some lawyers to be an effect of the marriage contract, imposed on the husband by the law as a mark of respect for the subject of the contract the wife; whilst others consider that it is in exchange for the usufruct of the wife, and its payment is necessary, as upon a provision of support to the wife depends the permanency of the matrimonial contract. Thus, it is indispensable, a fortiori, so much so, that if it were not mentioned in the marriage contract, it would still be incumbent on the husband, as the law will presume it by virtue of the contract itself, and award it upon demand being made by the wife.  Payment  of  dower  is  obligatory  on  the  husband  and dower, thus, under no circumstances, can be said to be a benefit which a husband bestows on the bride as a consequence of the marriage; it is wife”≥ entitlement and right as a consideration of marriage.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n19.     The classification of dower as prompt and deferred has no legal sanction behind it, except the general practice in Muslim society for the convenience of the parties.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nThe concept and wisdom in classification of dower as prompt and deferred depends upon the relationship of party and protection of right of women in un-foreseen circumstances without taking away her right of demand of payment of dower till the marriage is not dissolved. The postponement of the payment of dower for an indefinite period would not mean that the same cannot be claimed before the dissolution of marriage and if it is considered as such, it would negate the concept of dower in Islam as well as defeat the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961. The deferred dower is source of guarantee for a woman against ill-treatment, non-maintenance, desertion or any other abnormality in the family life. Thus, the payment of deferred dower is deemed to be postponed till either the specified time and if not time is specified, till the wife demands it. It is laid down in Holy Quran in verse 124, Sura An-Nisa as under:-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n‘ìeeing that you derive benefit from them, give them their dower as prescribed‘ç\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n20.     The commands of Allah (SWT) given in the Holy Quran\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(Sura An-Nisa, V.R. 4) reads as under: ----\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n‘Åt the time of marriage, give the women their dowers willingly as an obligation, but if they, by their own free will, give up to you a portion of it then you may enjoy it with pleasure.‘ç\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n21.     The English rendering of the above Verse, given in the ‘îranslation of the meanings of the Holy Quran by Dr. Muhammad   Taqi-ud-Din   Al-Hilali   and   Dr.   Muhammad Muhsin Khan, published by the King Fahd Complex for the Printing of Holy Quran, Madniah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reads as under: ----\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n‘Ånd  give  to  the  women  (whom  you  marry) their  Mahr  (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allah has made it lawful).‘ç\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n22.     I am also fortified in my opinion from the view taken by the Honourable High Court in its authoritative judgments cited as 2006 YLR 33 (Lahore) {Muhammad Azam versus Additional District Judge and others} and  2000 CLC 1384 (Lahore) {Dr. Sabira Sultana versus Maqsood Sulqari, Additional District and Sessions Judge, Rawalpindi and 2 others} where it is held that the dower whether prompt or deferred is an inalienable right of wife and after consummation, same would become vested right of a wife at any time. Pronouncement of Talaq is not a pre-condition for the maintainability of the suit for recovery of dower.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n23.     For what has been discussed above, this writ petition is\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDismissed in limine.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nM.

District Police Officer etc.)\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nDate of hearing:                                   28.08.2014 	\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPetitioner by:                   Malik Bakht Yar Mahdi, Advocate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRespondent by:                Mr. Aurangzeb Khan, AAG.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n≈Ö≈Ö≈Ö≈Ö≈Ö≈Ö\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nSIKANDAR ZULQARNAIN SALEEM, J.- After hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner notice is issued to the respondents. Learned AAG present in court accepts notice on behalf of official respondents and with the concurrence of both the learned counsel for the parties, this case is decided today as a Pakka case.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.       Muhammad Rehman petitioner has invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199  of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 for quashing of FIR No. 344/2014, dated 04.08.2014, registered under Sections 302/148/149 PPC read with Section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 at Police Station City District Vehari on the ground that Report registered at the instance of respondent No. 5 Ali Arsalan is second in series regarding which occurrence, case FIR No. 341 of 2014 was already registered at the instance of respondent No. 4 under sections 324/337-H2/148/149 of The  Pakistan  Penal  Code,  1860  against  the present  petitioner  and others.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.       Brief facts relevant for decision of instant writ petition are that initially a case FIR No. 341 dated 2.8.2014 under sections 324/337- H2/148/149 PPC at Police Station City Vehari was lodged against the\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\npetitioner and others at the instance of respondent No. 4 alleging therein that on the intervening night of 1/2.8.2014 Tasawar Hussain brother  of  the  complainant  and  Azhar  Hussain  went  to  X-Block Peoples Colony for making movie on the marriage of Mohsin Raza. Zeeshan Haider, Rehman, Asghar, Wasim, Ghulam Bheek alias Abubakar Gujjar, Zahid, Luqman, Umer and 15 unknown persons who  were  armed  with  firearm  weapons  also  came  in  the  said ceremony and asked Azhar Hussain to make their movie also. Azhar Hussain replied that he would make their movie just after changing the video cassette, whereupon the accused persons flared up and tortured him brutally who sustained injuries on different parts of his body. On hue and cry the complainant alongwith his brother Tasawar Hussain, Muhammad Atif and Nazar Abbas attracted to the spot. The accused persons hit their Pajero straightly to Tasawar Hussain brother of the complainant who fell on the ground and within their views the accused persons passed over the said Pajero on the person of Tasawar Hussain, whereupon he became injured severely.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.       However,  story  of  the  second  FIR  bearing  No.  344  dated\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.8.2014 registered at the instance of respondent No. 5 Ali Arsalan son of Tasawar Hussain deceased is that on 1.8.2014 Azhar Hussain uncle  of  the  complainant  who  was  a  movie  maker  was  hired  by Mohsin Raza resident of X-Block Street No. 8 to make the video film of his marriage. Nazar Abbas his brother was also alongwith Azhar Hussain. At about 12.30 a.m. Nazar Abbas uncle of the complainant rushed towards the complainant and informed that Azhar Hussain was being tortured by the accused persons whereupon he rushed to rescue his life. On this information, the complainant along with his father Tasawar Hussain and Mazhar-ul-Islam alias Muhammad Atif ran towards the place of occurrence. As soon as they reached in Jernail Chowk they saw in the street light that a Dala Surf Pejaro type driven by Zahid and Ghulam Bhaik alias Abubakar and Rehman armed with automatic firearm weapons were making firing and creating terrorism\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nand were forcing Azhar Hussain to run in front of above said vehicle. Tasawar Hussain father of the complainant came forward to rescue Azhar Hussain who set him aside. Ghulam Bheek alias Abu Bakar and Rehman (petitioner) raised a lalkara to kill him whereupon Zahid accused trampled Tasawar Hussain with above said vehicle while passing over him and then he again trampled the father of the complainant while reversing the above said vehicle. The accused persons escaped from the place of occurrence while making aerial firing. The complainant along with Amjad Javed and Muhammad Atif real uncle of complainant attended the injured and took him to DHQ Hospital Vehari. From where the injured was referred to the Nishtar Hospital,  Multan  after  providing  first  aid  treatment  to  him.  The injured succumbed to the injuries yesterday at 7.30 p.m. The complainant alongwith witnesses remained busy to rescue the injured whereupon they could not get registered the case. Meanwhile, the accused persons manipulated the medical from the DHQ Hospital and registered a performa FIR of their own choice in connivance with the SHO, which was in fact was not registered by the uncle of the complainant  rather  he  was  busy  with  the  injured  at  the  Nishtar Hospital, Multan.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe motive behind the occurrence as alleged in the FIR was stated to be that the accused persons had brought a dancing girl on the marriage ceremony and they were enjoying nude dance and asked the uncle of the complainant namely Azhar Hussain to make their video film continuously but on discontinuation of DVD they flared up and started for torturing him and also broke the camera and when Azhar Hussain on the intervention of Nazar Abbas rescued his life and ran from there, the accused persons have committed the above said occurrence.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5.       Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the story given in the second FIR by the complainant is an afterthought and does not appeal to the prudent mind as reasons advanced for registration of the\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nsecond FIR are flimsy, fictitious and the second FIR stood registered just to bring more heinousness into the allegations and to fill up the lacunas in the prosecution”≥ case. It is further submitted that in both the FIR, the place of occurrence, time of occurrence, articles used for the commission of alleged offence, set of the accused and the witnesses, the injured/deceased, initiation of the alleged occurrence are the same, hence, there was no need for registration of second FIR as registration of second FIR is nothing but abuse of process of law and continuation of the same would be nothing but the wastage of time. It is next contended that this Court has ample power to quash/cancel the FIR and redress the grievance of petitioner being custodian  of  fundamental  rights  of  the  citizens;  hence,  this  writ petition be accepted and the FIR impugned in this petition is liable to be quashed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6.       It is resisted by the learned Assistant Advocate General with the arguments that writ petition seeking quashing of the FIR is not maintainable as number of efficacious remedies are available to the aggrieved petitioner; that the writ petition is lodged with mala fide intention; that petitioner has not been able to make out any factual or legal infirmity to seek quashing of FIR by invoking the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court, therefore, this petition is liable to be dismissed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n7.       We  have  given  patient  hearing  to  learned  counsel  for  the parties, learned AAG and gone through the record.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n8.     Question  for  consideration  is  whether  in  the  given circumstances registration of second FIR is nullity in the eye of law and as such FIR is required to be quashed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n9.       Text of Section 154 Cr.P.C. suggests that if oral information regarding commission of a cognizable offence is communicated to an officer incharge of police station, it shall be reduced into writing by him or under his direction and be read over to the informant. No line\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nof distinction and demarcation has been made in the said provision of law putting embargo to lay information before police even after the registration of first Report regarding the same occurrence.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n10.     Perusal of accusation contained in both the reports suggests that it is a case of two versions. Firstly, introduced by Amjad brother of the deceased being complainant of FIR No. 341 of 2014 is altogether different from the second version introduced by Ali Arsalan son of Tasawar Hussain deceased with reference to initiation of occurrence, motive of the occurrence, accused participated in the occurrence, the roles played by the accused during the alleged occurrence. In view of the matter, version introduced at the instance of respondent No. 5 Ali Arsalan, entirely gives a different version and the same is not an elaboration, explanation or amplification of first FIR, therefore, there is no legal bar for registration of second FIR.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n11.     Needless to say that for quashing of FIR following grounds are ordinarily considered:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(a)     jurisdictional defect patent on the record; (b)     patent violation of some provision of law;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(c)	allegations contained in the FIR does not constitute an offence; and\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the instant case, however, learned counsel for the petitioner has not been able to make out any of the above noted grounds to substantiate his plea for quashing of FIR. It is settled proposition of law that High Court has no jurisdiction to resolve the disputed question of fact in a constitutional jurisdiction. It has been squarely settled that quashing of the  FIR  by  appreciating  the  arguments  advanced  by  the  learned counsel for the petitioner would amount to bypass the normal procedure of law prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Code 1898. Certainly, an accused cannot be allowed to avoid ordinary course of trial before the Court of competent jurisdiction, if prima facie the offence is made out against him, by resorting to constitutional Jurisdiction of High Court. Quashing of FIR during the investigation\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\namounts   to   throttling   the   investigation   process,   which   is   not permissible in law. By now, it is settled too; that ordinary course of trial before the courts should not be allowed to be deflected by resorting to constitutional jurisdiction of High Court, if prima facie an offence has been committed. By allowing the constitutional petition it would be erred in law to all the procedures prescribed under Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 which would become redundant. Quashing the proceedings summarily would create chaos due to following:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(i)      To  interfere  in  sphere  allotted  to  the  executive organ.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(ii)     There  is  likely  hood  of  injustice  in  summary disposal.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(iii)    The  cases  are  quashed  at  initial  stages  then  it would create law and order situation as the people may  resort  to  taking  revenge  from the  opposite party.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe  conduct  and  manner  of  investigation  normally  is  scrutinized under the constitutional jurisdiction which might amount to interfere in police investigation as the same could not be substituted by the Court. To quash the FIR on the ground that there are two FIRs regarding the same occurrence and case is false would be to act on treacherous grounds and would tantamount to an uncalled for interference  by  the  Court  with  the  duties  of  the  police.  Even otherwise, accused have following alternate remedies under the code of Criminal Procedure.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(1)      To prove their innocence they can appear before\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestigating Officer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(2)     Can approach the competent higher authorities of the investigating officer having power vide Section\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n551-of Cr.P.C.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(3)    Investigating Officer has to submit case to the concerned Magistrate after completion of the investigation and in case of innocence of accused the Magistrate has power to discharge them under section 63 of the Cr.P.C.\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n(4)    The Magistrate even at the time of taking of cognizance,  would  refuse  to  take  cognizance  in case  he  finds  the  accused  innocent.  Under  the orders of the concerned Magistrate, Rule 24.7 of Police Rules, 1934 makes a provision for cancellation of case during the course of investigation.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n12.     It  is  for  the  Investigating  Officer  to  collect  the  evidence, connected with the case and if he finds that no offence is committed, he may submit a report under section 173, Cr.P.C. to the learned Ilaqa Magistrate if he finds otherwise, he has to submit report accordingly. The investigation of case is held with a view to ascertain whether or not an offence has been committed. In my humble view, it will tantamount  to  act  against  the  spirit  of  the  law,  if  the  police  is restrained from investigating the matter which is their statutory duty. It is always the duty of the investigating agency not only to investigate the matter in a manner to connect the accused with the commission of crime but also to save the innocent persons from the agony of endless investigation and trial.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n13.     It is a settled proposition of law that a High Court is duty bound to protect life, liberty, dignity and honour of every citizen of Pakistan as enunciated in the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973.  Therefore, when the statute law is not sufficient to meet a situation, it must take extraordinary measures and provide protection to him. It must, therefore, extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan come to the citizen as an aid or safeguard. Similarly, the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court under section 561-A Cr.P.C. is neither alternative nor additional in its characteristics and is to be rarely invoked only in the interest of justice so  as  to  redress  of  grievances  for  which  no  other  procedure  is available and  the provision should  not be used  to  circumvent the ordinary course of criminal procedure. In the case of  Dr. Ghulam Mustafa vs. The State and others (2008 SCMR 76),  the Hon”¢le Apex Court has settled that the High Court has no jurisdiction to\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nquash the FIR while exercising Constitutional power under Article\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n199 of the Constitution or under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. except in exceptional circumstances. Learned counsel for the petitioner has not been able to make out any exceptional ground for quashing of the FIR,  therefore,  petitioner  has  no  case  to  invoke the  constitutional jurisdiction of this Court.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNo material or substance is available on record on the basis whereof, FIR No. 344/2014, dated 04.08.2014, registered under Sections 302/148/149 PPC read with Section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1997 at Police Station City District Vehari be quashed neither any convincing argument has been advanced nor is any legal aspect available to help the petitioner in this regard. It is neither the case of double jeopardy nor a case of double incrimination.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n14.     For what has been discussed above, we do not find any factual or legal infirmity in registration of the FIR. This petition having no merits is hereby dismissed.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n(MUHAMMAD QASIM KHAN)         (SIKANDAR ZULQARNAIN SAL1EEM)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGE                                                                       JUDGE\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nAPPROVED  FOR REPORTING\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nJUDGE                      JUDGE\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMaqsood/*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'PLD 2010 SC 1165, PLD 1992 SC 595 at 621, AIR 1973 SC 1641, AIR 1975 SC 2299, PLD 1972 SC 139, 5 U.S. 137 (1803), PLD 1996 SC 324, PLD 2009 SC 879, AIR 1994 SC 268, AIR 1999 SC 1, AIR 1965 SC 845, AIR 1967 SC 1643, AIR 1981 SC 271, AIR 2007 SC 861, 1989 BLD (Supplement) 1, PLD 1963 SC 486, PLD 1997 SC 426, PLD 1998 SC 1263, PLD 2000 SC 869, PLD 2005 SC 719, PLD 1976 SC 57, PLD 1973 SC 49, PLD 1977 SC 657, 1993 SCMR 1718, PLD 1966 SC 2291999 SCMR 640PLD 1992 SC 595'),
